0,1001.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,AMERICAN IN PEKING DOUBTS ACUPUNCTURE AS TREATMENT,"Acupuncture for anesthesia works remarkably well, but it is far less effective than the claims made for it in treating chronic or acute illness, in the view of David Eisenberg, the first American allowed to study for an extended period at the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine here.Mr. Eisenberg, a 25-year-old fourth-year student at the Harvard Medical School and a native of Woodmere, L.I., has just completed a year in China as an exchange scholar. He received his diploma from the institute last week after dealing with several hundred patients, an unusual privilege for a foreigner.Mr. Eisenberg said in an interview that he had come in the hope of learning ''what could be of value in traditional Chinese medicine to health-care professionals in the West.'' He will return to Harvard still uncertain what can be transferred. Sitting in his small room on a tile-roofed courtyard, he asked, as he often has over the past 12 months, '' How much of traditional Chinese medicine really works?'' His answer: ''A lot of it really works and a lot is really nonsense.'' Trust in the DoctorA key element is the doctor-patient relationship, said Mr.  Eisenberg, who studied Chinese at Harvard and in Taiwan. He explained: ''In traditional Chinese medicine so much depends on the trust the patient puts in the doctor, so there is an element of faith healing. I have seen 80-year-old Chinese doctors who elicit such trust in their patients that whether they are pressing the right acupuncture points or prescribing the right herbal drugs, the patient's illness is going to improve radically. Whether or not Western medicine can explain why the remedy works, it does.''He has found the doctors here to be less condescending than those at home, he said, adding that ''in America doctors think of themselves as an elite;'' here they draw an average salary of $43 a month, much the same as skilled factory workers or middle-aged office workers.People go into medicine for the personal satisfaction or because of family connections, Mr. Eisenberg has found. Students who get the highest scores on the college entrance examinations chose more glamorous fields such as nuclear physics and engineering. So there has to be a sense of commitment, Mr. Eisenberg said, as in the case of his professor of herbal medicine, who maintains that members of his family have been doctors for 19 generations.While working in the acupuncture clinic for a month, Mr. Eisenberg was surprised when roughly half the 100 patients he talked with said they were suffering from ''weakness of the nerves'' - what in the United States might be called nervous tension. Deep-Seated Complaints ElicitedThese patients and people Mr. Eisenberg met on trains, in taxicabs and in restaurants usually complained of the same symptoms: anxiety, insomnia, loss of energy, headaches and irritability.  When Mr.  Eisenberg began to probe into their troubles, he elicited deepseated problems: political persecution, depression among students unable to fulfill parental expectations, dissatisfaction among husbands and wives separated by job assignment, loneliness among elderly women.''The patients themselves believed their problems had a purely physical origin, as did the Chinese doctors who examined them and prescribed a physical cure,'' the American said. ''This makes having 'weakness of the nerves' socially acceptable.''Chinese medicine does not recognize Freud's theory of the unconscious, he went on, so doctors do not look into patients' psyches or their social background. Moreover, a Freudian interpretation could make it appear that the political or social system was to blame.Discussing the effectiveness of acupuncture, Mr. Eisenberg conceded that he had come with a bias in favor of it. ''I had hoped to see people with problems who responded dramatically to the needles in ways which Western medicine couldn't help them,'' he said, citing sprained ankles, wrenched backs and migraine headaches, which enthusiasts maintain needles can alleviate. Few Responses Were Dramatic''But out of 100 patients who came in, only a handful showed dramatic responses,'' he related. ''Surely the stroke patients slowly recuperated, the chronic lower-back aches felt a bit better. But all of these took a considerable period of time and none convinced me of acupuncture's superiority over Western medicine. That's not what New Yorkers with headaches and backaches want to hear.''Mr. Eisenberg was interested to find patients who came often for acupuncture and were uncomfortable without it; he was tempted to conclude that they might be addicted to the needles. This could be important in understanding how acupuncture works, he noted, for ''there is a lot of suggestive material in Western medical journals that one of the mechanisms by which acupuncture works is that it stimulates natural morphinelike substances, narcoticlike receptors.''Like almost all the American doctors who have been to China, Mr.  Eisenberg said he had been thoroughly impressed by acupuncture used for anesthesia. Problems of Complex SystemConcerning the two other branches of traditional medicine, herbal medicine and therapeutic massage, Mr. Eisenberg said that, again, he was not clear in his own mind. With 10,000 herbs, and 10 or 15 of them in each prescription, it is difficult to establish the scientific basis of Chinese pharmacology, at least by Western standards, he said. Also, he said, it is hard for Westerners to penetrate to a theoretical basis for Chinese pharmacology.''Take a man who comes in with a high fever, cough and some pain in his lungs,'' Mr. Eisenberg said. ''An examination and X-ray using Western medicine would show he had pneumonia, but a Chinese doctor takes a brief medical history, looks at his tongue, the skin, and feels the pulse. From this he makes a diagnosis of 'weak blood, internal fire,' and prescribes a brew of herbs.''But not every patient who has pneumonia by Western standards is suffering from ''weak blood, internal fire,'' according to Chinese practice, Mr. Eisenberg said, and the next patient might be diagnosed as having a different imbalance and given a different prescription.  It is such differences that have made trying to integrate Chinese and Western medicine difficult, and China has not really succeeded, despite official claims, Mr.Eisenberg asserted."

""But a lot of people around here don't care. It's cheap.""  Clinics that specialize in traditional medicine fill a niche in communities of Chinese immigrants. Illegal immigrants, people who cannot speak English and those who cannot afford insurance or uninsured hospital care often turn to them for medical attention. Few people care if the clinics are licensed. Dozens thrive in the neighborhood.There is a strip of the clinics on the second floors of buildings along 41st Avenue near Main Street, said Cheng Wang, a Flushing truck driver who seeks massage therapy for back pains. And on that block, at least three shops sell pungent herbal medicine from sidewalk stands. Sometimes the clinics are run from the back rooms of apartments.""The one thing that concerned me when this was brought to me,"" said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, ""was if I moved forward on this, will I be keeping people from medical attention that they otherwise might not be able to get?""The investigation began in May after Mr. Brown's office learned of a lawsuit filed by a patient, Chunxi Qiao, who contended that the clinic had botched the removal of an intrauterine device. The authorities have charged six unlicensed practitioners at the clinic, including its owner, Shou Dong Wang.Hugh H. Mo, a lawyer for the defendants named in the civil lawsuit, said his clients were disputing that they gave improper treatment.Many Flushing residents do not see a problem with most of the traditional medicine clinics. Mr. Wang, the truck driver, said he had gone to three different clinics for back pain until he found one on Roosevelt Avenue that could relieve his suffering with a $35 massage.But the problems come when the clinics practice Western medicine, which they sometimes do for relatively low prices, several Flushing residents said. ""They're not doctors,"" said Sprinz Chou, the manager of a hair salon next to the shuttered clinic. ""I think people are crazy to go there.""Ms. Chou, who moved to the United States 30 years ago, said that she had a customer who complained two months ago about treatment she had received at the clinic.""I said, 'If it's not so good, why did you go?' "" she said. ""She said she wanted to check it out after a friend recommended it.""Ms. Qiao, the woman who sued the clinic, said in an affidavit that she first went there last November for neck pains. But, according to her affidavit, clinicians botched the aftermath of a subsequent IUD removal.That took place on Nov. 13, lasting 10 to 15 minutes. Afterward, Ms. Qiao said, the clinic gave her herbal medicine for her recovery.That afternoon, Ms. Qiao said, she took the medicine. For two days, she experienced stomach pains and other symptoms.On Nov. 15, a frightened Ms. Qiao went to the clinic, where she discovered that a doctor had mistakenly switched her medicine with that of another patient, she said. She was given another medicine, but her symptoms continued, she said. The next morning, she went to Flushing Hospital, where doctors put her on intravenous medication. She filed a lawsuit with the State Supreme Court for medical negligence in January.""No one should have to go through such pain like I went through,"" she said in her affidavit. ""No one should have to feel as I do now.""  http://www.nytimes.com"
2,1003.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Chinese Medicine Proves Itself Where Western Medicine Fails,"To the Editor:Your Sept. 4 report from Beijing on the traditional Chinese healing art of qi gong is an example of why Americans remain ignorant about traditional Chinese medicine technology. There should be no implication that a qi gong doctor bases disease diagnoses on the presence of ear wax, nor comparison of the recent growth in interest in qi gong to a 19th century stir caused when a Chinese man claimed to be the brother of Jesus.I am a medical doctor from China, an internist and an epidemiologist. While I am proud of what Western medicine can do for many patients, I am acutely aware of its limitations. When I and other medical doctors in China find patient conditions that are not easily treated with Western techniques, we often send the patients to the Chinese medicine department of the hospital, where acupuncture, qi gong and Chinese herbal therapies often achieve greater success. Hundreds of scientific studies illustrate the medical benefits of qi gong. In one study of more than 100 advanced cancer patients by the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, the control group was treated only with Western drugs. The experimental group was treated with the same Western drugs, plus qi gong. The experimental group gained strength and weight and showed improved macrophage activity, all statistically significant results, while the control group showed overall decreases on these same measures.In another study, performed at the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the electroencephalogram power spectrum of a subject was measured while a qi gong doctor emitted qi (what you call ''a vague concept that can refer to air or gas or a vague spirit or life force'') from his hands while standing across the room. During and for a short time after the emission, the EEG power spectrum synchronized and intensified in the alpha range.To eliminate placebo effects, a similar shift in EEG was observed when the test subject was replaced with sleeping cats and rabbits. Electronic equipment has even been developed that simulates the emitted energy of a qi gong doctor and creates similar shifts in the EEG power spectrum.I agree that there are those who offer unrealistic claims under the banner of qi gong for the sake of profit. But a deeper look is required before branding all of qi gong as a passing religious fad. YUAN ZHI FU  San Clemente, Calif., Sept. 17, 1990The writer is licensed as an acupuncturist."
3,1004.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,BEYOND ACUPUNCTURE,"ENCOUNTERS WITH QI Exploring Chinese Medicine. By David Eisenberg with Thomas Lee Wright. Illustrated. 254 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $16.95.ONCE when he was living in China, David Eisenberg relates, ''a group of schoolchildren gently took hold of my arms and walked me across the street. Having noticed my blue-gray eyes, they assumed I was totally blind and wanted to escort me through the traffic.'' But to judge by ''Encounters With Qi,'' a vivid glimpse of traditional Chinese medicine, Dr. Eisenberg is far from blind. A doctor of internal medecine and a clinical research fellow at Harvard Medical School, he began studying Chinese as a college freshman. He was the first American medical exchange student in the People's Republic of China, spending 1979-80 studying traditional Chinese medicine. Besides being tutored in the subject, he worked alongside his instructors in clinics specializing in acupuncture, massage and herbal therapy (the main traditional mode of treatment). His experience provided him with anecdotal evidence suggesting that such methods are sometimes of considerable value in controlling discomfort and may also aid in managing disease.In ''Encounters With Qi,'' Dr. Eisenberg shares observations made during this stay and on shorter visits to China. Work introducing Westerners to traditional Chinese medicine has tended to be forbiddingly dry and abstract, but this account is highly readable, in part because case histories, human interest, dialogue and local color abound. While it generally avoids the topic of Western-style medicine - much practiced in China, particularly in the urban centers - it ranges widely.For example, Dr. Eisenberg cites the key role of tongue inspection (a major diagnostic technique in traditional Chinese medicine) and suggests that Western clinicians may have something to learn in this regard. He notes that in many instances Chinese physicians, who were considered responsible for teaching how to live healthily, used to be paid only so long as their patients remained well. He describes the status of doctors in contemporary China. He even presents analogies and links between Chinese medicine and Chinese cooking.The ''qi'' (pronounced chee) of the title is a central concept, meaning something like ''vital energy.'' Dr. Eisenberg reports being taught that acupuncture and acupressure massage are intended to correct imbalances and stagnations of qi in the body and that herbal remedies are designed to rectify excesses and deficiencies of qi. He notes the controversial claim made by some Chinese that qi is not merely an intellectual construct but rather something physical that can be directed outward, for example, to move objects. And he describes, with the balance of open-mindedness and skepticism that characterizes this book, demonstrations seeming to support the contention.Whether qi is indeed somehow a physical reality and to what extent and in what circumstances various Chinese therapies are effective remain unanswered questions. But Dr. Eisenberg calls for careful Western-style research, so Chinese and Western medicine can be integrated and the most effective elements from either source applied in each case.As he admits, such research is not easy. In China and elsewhere, specialists in traditional Chinese medicine and those in Western medicine rarely share ideas or patients. And the conceptual frameworks of the systems, including diagnostic categories, are so widely disparate that studies may be nearly impossible to design. But if Dr. Eisenberg's observations foreshadow what is to come, the exploration of Chinese medicine will produce findings that are intriguing and that the West may find medically useful."
4,1005.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A Chinese Art, In the Context Of the West","Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been in use for thousands of years.   At your first evaluation, a practitioner will examine your tongue for clues like cracks and discolorations, take your pulse and ask numerous questions to determine what might be causing your symptoms.    The practitioner will then insert fine needles at specific points to unblock the flow of qi, or energy, in your body. Sound like hocus pocus?   Many Western doctors think not.   ''Acupuncture is a system of correspondences,'' said Vitaly Napadow, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, who conducts research on how acupuncture affects the brain. ''Different ailments or diseases can be explained through traditional Chinese medical theory or through modern biomedical physiology, with sometimes interesting correspondence between the two,'' said Dr. Napadow, who has a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering  and is also a licensed acupuncturist.  ''I've been practicing for eight years and have seen acupuncture help with surprisingly diverse issues, like plantar fasciitis and diabetic neuropathy,'' he said. ''Acupuncture affects many systems in the body, including parts of the brain that are involved with processing emotion and pain.'' LESLEY ALDERMAN "

Emmet Clarie of Federal District Court Tuesday gave the mother, Juliet Cheng, two months to try herbs, acupuncture, vitamins and physical therapy to treat her daughter for severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. But Ms. Cheng will not be allowed to take Shirley back to China for treatment as she had hoped.Under the agreement, Ms. Cheng will have to keep her daughter in the United States while she receives traditional Chinese treatment over the next two months. Ms. Cheng will also have to accept a final recommendation from a panel of three physicians who will examine the girl after the trial period.Doctors at Newington Children's Hospital have said surgery on tissue around joints in Shirley's legs would help her walk again. But her mother, who has taken the girl to China for treatment four times, insists that only traditional Chinese medicine can help her daughter."
6,1007.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,The good points of acupuncture," Suddenly, the idea seems to be everywhere - on television, in articles, among  friends - that the Chinese might have medical secrets we Westerners need to  learn.Americans increasingly are trying new therapies for their ailments,  particularly for chronic complaints such as backaches, headaches and stress.  The New England Journal of Medicine reported in January that one in three  Americans now bypasses the usual medical doctor, spending $ 14-billion a year  on alternative treatments.The alternatives take many forms, but among the most intriguing is  traditional Chinese medicine, a combination of acupuncture, herbs and massage  that has been used in China for thousands of years.""It has been a silent issue until now because many people were very  skeptical about the practice,"" said Barbara Bernie of the American Foundation  of Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco. ""It has changed because  many people are now finding that, in fact, it does work in many cases, and  they're able to talk about it comfortably."" Chinese doctors brought acupuncture to this country 20 years ago after  President Nixon re-established ties with China. Among the doctors was Su Liang  Ku, who now has clinics in Pinellas and Hillsborough counties and teaches  traditional Chinese medicine from his school in Pinellas Park.""When we first started 10, 15 years ago, most patients came to us as a  last resort,"" Ku said. ""Now, 50 percent of the patients come to us as a  first resort.""At first, acupuncturists could practice only under the supervision of a  Western-trained medical doctor. Now about half the states, including Florida,  license them to work alone if they have been formally trained.The Chinese theory, in its simplest terms, is that channels of energy or  chi flow through the body and must be kept clear for the body to remain in  balance, physically and emotionally.Herbs and acupuncture, the placement of thin needles at specific points on  the body, may clear the channels.""We don't separate the mind from the body from the spirit,"" said Bernie  in San Francisco. ""If it's an emotional problem, it's going to affect us  physically. If it's a physical problem, it's going to affect us emotionally.""Western research, too, has shown a connection between mind and body. And  American patients keep swearing that alternative treatments work.More Western doctors are becoming interested in Chinese medicine,  particularly when they hear about its benefits from their peers. Dr. David  Eisenberg, for example, teaches at Harvard Medical School and recently guided  journalist Bill Moyers through the Chinese medical system for a PBS show  called Healing and the Mind. Eisenberg was the first American student sent to  China years ago to learn the ancient techniques.As the movement gathers steam in the United States, more medical doctors  are incorporating acupuncture into their practices. The American Association  of Medical Acupuncturists has about 2,000 members, medical school doctors who  practice acupuncture.The Suncoast Center for Natural Health in Tampa has begun teaching  acupuncture in its Traditional Chinese Medicine department and will have 50  students by September, school officials say.Bernie is helping set up elective courses for medical students at the  University of California who want to study Chinese methods.Acupuncture is already being used in some mainstream places like Miami's  Drug Court, a special drug offense courtroom where needle treatments  apparently help first-time offenders overcome their addictions. The vast  majority of offenders who have gone through the Drug Court have not been  arrested again, said public defender Hugh Rodham.The National Institutes of Health recently opened an Office of Alternative  Medicine, setting aside $ 2-million to study unorthodox treatments.Despite at least 3,000 years of experience in China, many Western doctors  see no scientific proof that alternative treatments help. Studies are still  few. Some patients might have improved anyway. Or it might be the placebo  effect: The patients feel better because they expected to.""The champions of alternative medicine shouldn't expect to be believed  unless they meet rigorous standards,"" Dr. Arnold Relman of Harvard told the  New York Times last year. ""But on the other side, the traditional biomedical  establishment ought not to prejudge. All biases and prejudices ought to fall  before the evidence.""The American Medical Association has no position on alternative treatments,  pro or con.Ku began learning the Chinese methods as an apprentice to his grandfather.  Ku's wife, Nini Ku, is a Western-trained medical doctor whose approach to the  human body is completely different from her husband's. She is assistant  director of the pathology department at the University of South Florida.""She believes because she sees it work,"" Ku said, ""but she doesn't  understand, according to her theory, how does this work.""Even practitioners can't explain the chi.""We cannot see this energy,"" Bernie said. ""We still do not know exactly  where it exists in the body.""  Better quality of lifeThe shelves at Ku's school for Chinese medicine are lined with Mason jars,  neatly labeled.Lampwick herb.Mugwort leaf.Dragon's blood.Myrrh. Knotweed.One jar is half full of the dried, translucent bodies of cicadas.The Chinese learned over the centuries to use whatever was available in  nature to cure their ailments or at least to ease suffering.""Medicine is not just for cure,"" Ku said. ""There are cases you cannot  cure, but they (the patients) are living. They want their life to be of better  quality, able to enjoy a life without suffering. That's what medicine is  about. We are able to fulfill that part of the need for many patients.""About 10,000 herbs in 100,000 combinations can be boiled into a  foul-tasting tea or, more often these days, taken in tablets. (Ku's office  manager, Carmen Miranda, said the doctor gave her some tablets for the flu  this past winter, but she shied away from taking them because the ingredients  included antelope. She didn't know which part of the antelope.)Herbs are nearly always prescribed along with acupuncture or massage  treatments.""Medicine is medicine,"" Ku said. ""If you use the right stuff to the  right person to the right condition where it is needed, it's the best because  that's what that person needs.""Chinese medicine involves painstaking diagnosis, discussing not only  physical symptoms but lifestyle.Taking a pulse, for example, is not simple, said Bernie in San Francisco.  Practitioners of Chinese medicine believe each wrist has six pulses with 27  qualities. They may feel a wrist for several minutes.""That's a way of finding out what is going on with a person's energy, by  checking their pulses,"" she said.The tongue is also useful for examination. The tip represents the heart,  the sides the gall bladder and liver, the surface tells about the stomach and  spleen. The color, texture and shape of the tongue, compared with the pulses,  tell doctors a great deal, Bernie said.Skin color and texture, hair and nails also give clues, she said.""We have to ask a person many questions, get to know a person, have them  tell us a great deal,"" Bernie said. ""Even though they come in with a  symptom, we have to find out what the cause of that problem is. It will  determine also what the treatment should be.""Two people can come in with the very same headache and the treatment can  be totally different. It's a very individual type of diagnosis and  treatment.""Bernie and Ku caution against expecting miracles from Chinese medicine. If  a patient comes in with joints twisted from arthritis, acupuncture won't  straighten them. But it might ease the pain by restoring the flow of energy  through the body.""The Chinese say, wherever there's a pain, there's a blockage,"" Ku said.  ""If you can unblock this blockage, the pain will subside.""Ku treats a great deal of pain, often in people who have been in automobile  accidents. He says such orthopedic problems have replaced the typhoid and  malaria of an earlier age. But now he is seeing more problems caused by  lifestyle - unhealthful foods, polluted air and water, stress, depression,  anxiety, overwork or joblessness.""All this imbalance of the lifestyle started to cause problems in their  body,"" Ku said.Chinese medicine has always emphasized a healthy lifestyle as preventive  medicine, he said, something that Western medicine has more recently begun to  do.""In Western medicine, somehow they see health and disease as two different  things,"" Ku said. ""They will say, well, you have no disease, so there's  nothing for you to be aware of or to do. They don't emphasize enough on how to  maintain their health.""  The best of bothPractitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have great respect for the  technology of the West. There's no Chinese substitute for an X-ray. Medical  students in China learn Western methods, and some are skeptical of the old  ways.But in both countries, a few doctors and researchers are trying to combine  the two methods for the best of both worlds.Already, Chinese medicine is being used to treat the symptoms of AIDS,  diabetes and multiple sclerosis and the side effects of chemotherapy for  cancer patients. It does not cure, but it seems to help.Some big cities have all-purpose clinics where medical doctors,  acupuncturists, herbalists and others work together. Bernie in San Francisco  is trying to develop an international health center to bring together medical  practices from around the world that aren't available in the United States.""We have to learn how to accommodate our body and treat it kindly,""  Bernie said.Helga Wall-Apelt is a German doctor now living in Longboat Key and studying  traditional Chinese medicine with Ku. She spent 25 years in internal medicine  and radiology in Germany but has done research rather than practice in the  United States.""I don't even want to renew my license because I think we have too many  physicians trained in the American way,"" she said. ""What we need now is the  background of Western medicine, but then take those strong sources of  traditional Chinese medicine based on a scientific foundation and implement  them into our own practice.""Learning Chinese medicine is as difficult as medical school, Wall-Apelt  said, and she deplores the idea that any layman can become licensed in Florida  after two years of studying acupuncture.Ku's classes often include nurses, psychologists, veterinarians or people  from other fields who are seeking a career change. Wall-Apelt personally would  restrict courses to health professionals or at least to those with college  degrees.But she is pleased that Western doctors are opening their minds to Chinese  teachings - evidenced by the number of doctors learning acupuncture and  referring patients to acupuncture clinics.""Physicians suddenly start to understand what it is all about, then they  get into the richness of this huge, tremendous knowledge of Chinese medicine  and these tremendous resources for health and disease, which we very much need  in this country to help patients,"" Wall-Apelt said.The problem with western medicine, she and the others said, is that it  compartmentalizes symptoms. One doctor will treat the eyes, another the bones,  another the organs. If there's an emotional problem, still another doctor  steps in.""The physicians do not understand that a patient is an entity, where so  many problems relate and cause disease and health problems and affect his  health,"" Wall-Apelt said. ""And also he has no time to really be aware and  talk to the patient. He sees his office too much as a business.""Patient-physician relationship is an art, and it is never a business. The  first concern is that the patient understands that you care for him and that  you are compassionate for him. The rest comes all by itself.""Wall-Apelt, 53, said she will train for another year with Ku and then hopes  to conduct seminars for Western doctors, lecturing and teaching about Chinese  medicine and its modern uses.""I think we are heading into a new age anyhow in how we practice  medicine,"" she said. ""Traditional Chinese medicine will certainly be a part  of it. If the Western physicians want it or not, they have to implement it  into their curriculum . . . to widen the scope of our knowledge of the human  being, to keep it healthy and to prevent diseases.""

7,1008.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Acupuncture school may lose its accreditation,"The Florida Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine is on the verge of having its accreditation stripped, a move that would likely close the 16-year-old acupuncture school.The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine recommended late last month that the school's accreditation be withdrawn. The school can appeal the decision, but success seems unlikely. An on-site inspection and the school's self-report revealed numerous problems, including non-compliance with 16 accreditation requirements. The commission wrote in its report that the ""entire institution is unstable.""""Given the extensiveness, pervasiveness and seriousness of these issues, the commission concludes that these deficiencies cannot be corrected within a reasonable period of time,"" the report states.Without accreditation, the school would not be eligible for federal grants and guaranteed loans, crippling the school's main source of funding. Also, without accreditation, students can't take the national exam, which is required to practice acupuncture.The St. Petersburg Times profiled the school's woes in January. Current and former students had complained about canceled classes, faculty attrition and poor record-keeping. The school's problems included lawsuits, an Internal Revenue Service lien and a foreclosure suit.Institute president Su Liang Ku, who opened the school at 5335 66th St. N in 1986, said the accreditation commission ""was overly punishing the school."" He agreed that the school had financial and administrative problems, but most of those stemmed from 2000 and 2001.The school had addressed the root of the problems, and now is getting rid of the remaining symptoms, he said.""I think the commission over-emphasized the problems,"" Ku said. ""If they were to dig deeper, they would know that all the causal factors have been removed.""About 60 students attend the school, where they learn acupuncture, among other disciplines. The three-year program costs about $23,000. Ku began the school as a certificate-granting program, but it eventually became degree-granting, which requires more stringent accreditation.Among other problems, the accreditation commission concluded:  + The program was financially unstable with no cash reserves and no line of credit. Budgets were not based on realistic enrollment projections or realistic assesments of department needs.+ The school-affiliated corporation that owns the property hadn't paid back property taxes, jeopardizing the facility.+ Ku has provided inadequate leadership, evidenced by substantial administrative problems and strategic errors.+ There are unacceptably high levels of staff turnover, inadequate student and staff files, and an insufficient library.The school can appeal the commission's decision. If that fails, the school can enter into binding arbitration. The process can take several months. Ku said he will appeal and thinks the school will remain open.Meanwhile, the classes students take might not be accredited, and thus won't count toward their degrees. If that is the case, Ku acknowledges, the school would not be able to continue much longer.""There would be no point for the students to keep going to class,"" he said.The school remains licensed by the state, said Guery Davis, a program specialist for the Florida Commission for Independent Education. The state will wait to see what happens with accreditation before taking action, he said.When a school is closed, the state helps remaining students by contracting with someone to teach them or by finding spots in similar schools, Davis said. - Graham Brink can be reached at (813) 226-3365 or brink@sptimes.com"
8,1009.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Healing touches,"Traditional Chinese medicine is no longer on the fringe in the West.In 1971, acupuncture was relatively unknown outside Asia. That's when the front page of the New York Times carried an article by White House correspondent James Reston on receiving the treatment for pain after an emergency appendectomy in China.But roughly 2.1-million U.S. adults reported having used acupuncture in 2001, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. There currently are 287 state-licensed acupuncturists in Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, Citrus and Hernando counties.One of the oldest healing modalities - it dates back several thousand years - traditional Chinese medicine (often termed TCM by practitioners and patients) comprises five branches:Acupuncture, which is what most people associate with Chinese medicine. In Florida, these practitioners must be licensed by a state agency.Herbal therapy.Tui na (massage and manipulation).Exercise therapy.Diet therapy.'An odd language'Based in Taoist philosophy, TCM views a person as a unified energy system, in which the body and mind balance each other. It takes a holistic approach to health and disease, treating the whole person.This is in contrast to the most common allopathic (Western) medicine - which is perhaps 200 years old and treats isolated illnesses and diseases and their symptoms.""Traditional Chinese medicine speaks an odd language,"" says Robert Linde, an acupuncture physician at Acupuncture & Herbal Therapy in St. Petersburg.At its most basic, TCM aims to restore balance between yin and yang, described as complementary opposites. Linde, a member of the American Herbalists Guild, says his job is to help create that balance in patients, allowing their bodies to heal.Ideally, he would prefer not to see patients in crisis but rather to teach them how to be well.""TCM won't cure cancer, although it can alleviate the side effects of treatment,"" says Jeff McConnell, who uses acupuncture among other complementary or alternative modalities in his clinic, Hands for Healing, Needles of Light, in St. Petersburg.""But a person whose body is in balance is less likely to develop health problems.""A consultation with a TCM practitioner can be quite different from walking into a medical doctor's office: The diagnostic methods acupuncturists and herbalists use include examining the tongue, taking the pulse, looking at the skin and asking questions that might seem irrelevant, such as whether you prefer hot or cold weather. They also have learned in their training to use the senses of hearing and smelling.A good TCM practitioner often will recommend that their patients go to an M.D. for lab and other diagnostic tests.Examining the five branchesAcupuncture: Hair-thin needles, generally 10 to 20, are inserted in the body at specific points according to the diagnosis. The stainless steel, one-time-use needles are manipulated to unblock and stimulate the flow of energy and thus restore balance to the body. They can be left in place from 10 minutes up to an hour. Acupuncture is considered particularly useful for acute and chronic pain, as well as gastrointestinal, gynecological and other problems.Herbal therapy: While herbs have been used for thousands of years all over the world, in Chinese medicine they are often combined in specific formulas based on the diagnosis. Given that certain herbs can interact with medications, it is important to let your medical doctor know if you are taking, or plan to take, any herbal formulas. Seek reliable sources for herbal preparations, as purity and potency can vary.Tui na (""twee nah""): This therapy uses a variety of massage techniques, acupressure (using pressure rather than needles) and cupping (drawing out toxins through the use of suction cups).Exercise therapy: This generally focuses on tai chi (a series of flowing movements designed to improve flexibility and relax the mind), and chi kung (breathing exercises in standing or sitting poses).Diet therapy: The use of food as medicine in TCM does not look at the Western concepts of vitamins, minerals, etc., but at the energetic properties of food, such as whether it's warming or cooling.Nancy Paradis can be reached at (727) 893-8342 or nparadis@sptimes.com.The Florida Department of Health's Board of Acupuncture licenses acupuncturists.

A recent graduate said she had to clean bathrooms herself because no one was hired to do the job. Students, who pay about $ 23,000 for a three-year degree, are frustrated. Morale is low. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming the school breached contracts and committed fraud. The state licensing commission also is looking into complaints.Worse yet, the school's financial disarray is jeopardizing its accreditation. Without accreditation, federal grants and guaranteed loans could dry up.""We have informed them in writing that they are on notice to show cause as to why they shouldn't have their accreditation withdrawn,"" said Roger J. Williams, executive director of ACCET, the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training.Among the recent financial troubles:+The Internal Revenue Service hit the school with a $ 45,735 lien in October for failure to pay payroll taxes. The school paid the lien three weeks ago.+A routine government audit revealed that the school kept thousands of dollars in unused student aid that should have been paid back to the U.S. Department of Education. The school negotiated a deal to pay back $ 73,581 in $ 1,500 monthly increments. Recently, the school renegotiated a deal to lower the monthly payments to $ 1,000.+The school closed its Tampa satellite campus and clinic at 1802 E Busch Blvd. in November. The Bank of America had begun foreclosure proceedings in September after the school stopped making payments on the $ 288,750 mortgage. The school recently sold the property, and the bank dropped the case. Tampa code enforcement also placed a lien on the property in September for failure to remove trash, which was eventually cleaned up.+The school settled a lawsuit for $ 11,900 with two former employees, Billy Potter and Jill Bevan, who said they were fired after they spoke out about what they believed were ""numerous violations of state and federal law"" regarding student financial aid and disbursements. The school is fighting two other lawsuits by students who claim officials misled them about the program and mistreated them when they complained. In one suit, the school's lawyer withdrew from the case, telling the judge that the school had stopped paying its legal bills.+The school's founder and president, Su Liang Ku, received about $ 200,000 in personal loans from family members two years in a row, which he pumped into the school. The loans represented 24 percent and 47 percent of the school's annual revenues in 1999 and 2000, according to independent audits conducted pursuant to licensing applications.+In 2000, Ku faced a $ 74,558 foreclosure suit on his personal rental property on 63rd Way N in St. Petersburg that was eventually resolved.School officials say they have always been able to get the money they needed when they needed it, said lawyer Jeffrey Blau. The school has a solid history, he said, and the quality of education is well regarded.""The graduates are well trained and go on to good careers,"" Blau said. ""That's the bottom line.""About 65 students currently attend the school. They learn acupuncture - the practice of inserting tiny needles into the body to stimulate healing - among other things. They are supposed to perform 800 hours of service at the student clinic, where they treat patients under the guidance of seasoned faculty members for a range of ailments from back pain to hay fever.Few of the school's detractors dispute the legitimacy of acupuncture. Some even praise the school's academic rigor and the quality of the professors. It's the way the school is run that raises questions.When Diana Thomas quit as clinic manager 18 months ago, she sensed she was fleeing a sinking ship. The school was filthy, she said, and the air conditioning barely worked. Thomas said she had trouble ordering paper towels because the school owed money to so many distributors.""The administration seemed to have no priorities except to just stay afloat,"" she said.Last summer, several students complained to the state about other problems. They said the school promised to offer a master's degree but then tried to tie it to an unexpected tuition increase. It turned out the school was not licensed to grant a master's degree.Former student Pamela Allen got so fed up she filed a lawsuit. Allen, a Lutz resident who transferred to the school in January 2000, listed a litany of problems: class schedules were changed or were inaccurate, staff quit and were fired on a regular basis, and the Tampa campus was understaffed.In fall 2000, the school asked  some students to sign a month's worth of missing attendance sheets just before an audit by an accrediting agency, Allen said, though some students had not attended all the classes. For months, Allen said, administrators strung her along about how much credit she would get for her 16 months at the Maryland Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine.Allen said she tried to get copies of her student records to substantiate that the school was keeping accurate records. She was told the records weren't available or the staff was unable to locate them. Another time, Allen said she was told she would have to find her own attendance records in the unstaffed registrar's office.Disgusted, Allen contacted Tampa lawyer William L. Yanger in April. Yanger said he set up meetings to resolve the problem but said the school did not accept the olive branch. After  the lawsuit was filed July 25, the sides agreed to mediation. The school canceled the meeting the day before it was to take place, court records show.Allen wrote to consumer and accrediting agencies to outline her complaints. In response to one of the letters, Blau wrote that Allen was ""out of control"" and that school officials would write to all the regional and national agencies that license acupuncture practitioners and tell them that they could not certify that Allen had the ""requisite mental stability to be permitted to practice traditional Chinese medicine."" Allen, 47, holds three degrees from Florida State University, including a  doctorate in mass communication. She has worked in Washington, D.C., with the Center for Population, Health and Nutrition and as a public health manager for Johns Hopkins University.""The mentally unstable tag was pure retaliation,"" Yanger said. ""She's smart, educated and she's right. That scares them.""Allen passed the National Board exams but doesn't have her diploma. The school claims she has course work left to complete. Allen says she has met all the requirements for graduation. Without the diploma, she cannot open a practice.Ku, 61, declined to answer questions.Blau said the school was willing to negotiate, but Allen made that impossible by continuing to  criticize the school in letters to accrediting agencies. Allen declined the school's offer to let her take the remaining classes on a one-on-one basis in Tampa and for her to make up the final exams that she missed, he said.""The school has done a lot to try to accommodate her,"" Blau said. ""The school cannot simply give Ms. Allen a degree when she hasn't completed the course work.""In December, the Florida State Board of Independent Colleges and Universities sent a committee to the school to check out complaints and see whether the school should be granted a higher level of accreditation.Cindy Bellia, assistant director for the commission, said preliminary reports suggested the school was okay academically, but signs of money woes raised ""red flags."" ""We'll be taking a closer look at those over the next few months,"" she said.- Times news researcher John Martin contributed to this report.

10,1011.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Acupuncture gets to the point of animals' maladies," Dr. Peggy Fleming watched as another doctor began checking her 1,200-pound patient, a horse with a chronic problem she hadn't been able to cure with traditional Western veterinary medicine.     As a last resort, the horse's owners invited an animal acupuncturist to treat the problem with traditional Chinese medicine.     The problem was the horse wasn't sweating. It had to be carefully supervised and given frequent cool showers during warm weather to prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke.      Halfway through the acupuncture treatment, beads of sweat appeared on the horse's neck.     ""I didn't believe in acupuncture, and, frankly, I was a little upset about it. When I went to watch, I was close-minded and very skeptical,"" Fleming recalled of the 1988 incident. ""But when the horse began sweating minutes into the treatment, I was surprised and shocked. I decided I'd better look into it.""     Fleming, an equine veterinarian based in Odessa, watched several more animals who seemed to respond to the treatments. ""I was fascinated,"" she said.     After completing a 120-hour course approved by the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society and a three-month internship, she began practicing equine acupuncture in 1989. She now treats about 70 acupuncture patients a week.  ""The best of both worlds is to combine Western medicine and acupuncture,"" Fleming said. ""For example, if you have pneumonia, use the appropriate antibiotic with acupuncture treatments to stimulate the immune system and promote healing.""     Fleming, 35, said she still is amazed the treatment works.     ""I'm in awe of it,"" she said. ""Sometimes it gives me goose bumps.""     Acupuncture has been used for more than a decade to relieve the pains and aches of professional performance horses.     Drugs are prohibited at many races and shows, so horses frequently are given an acupuncture vitamin ""performance shot"" before an event. The vitamins, injected into an acupuncture point on the back, act ""like 50 massages all at once,"" Fleming said.  Vitamins are natural substances and not considered drugs.     An acupuncture treatment before a performance is not a new idea.  A rock carving from about 200 B.C. in China shows soldiers performing acupuncture on horses with arrows before a battle, according to historians.     One of Fleming's first acupuncture clients was Noel Hickey, trainer, breeder and owner of Irish Acres Farm in Ocala. He hired her to treat a $ 500,000 horse that was lame and was going to be destroyed.     Acupuncture treatments cured the horse, Hickey said.     Hickey's equine empire includes several hundred horses. He keeps 50 to 60 at all times at race tracks around the country.     ""They're performance animals and they're going to have a lot of pains and aches and sprains and alignments out,"" he said.  ""Conventional veterinary medicine uses drugs to relieve those problems, but they're not a cure. You can only cortisone a joint so many times. With acupuncture, you get to the root of the problem.""     Hickey said he has been using acupuncture on his horses for 18 years.     ""I've no doubts of the value of acupuncture, that's been proven,"" he said. ""It's a case of the competency of the person using it. I've tried a couple of people who might as well have been sticking  needles in a pin cushion.""     Sisters Ann and Kris Huber, owners of Quarter Paint Farm in Hillsborough County, say acupuncture saved one of their young show horses from premature retirement.     ""My mare, Razzle, was 3 years old and had just won a world champion halter title when she was diagnosed with a bone spavin (a leg bone-related disease),"" said Kris Huber. ""A veterinarian told me there was no cure and to forget her career. But I couldn't afford to retire her and buy another quality show horse. We asked Dr.  Fleming to try acupuncture.     ""After a year of treatment, Razzle could be trained and we were able to show her again. It's been a year and a half now and another veterinarian hasn't found any evidence of the spavin.     Georgann Powers, who owns and operates the 40-horse Foxwood hunter-jumper training center in Pinellas Park, said one of her school horses was on medication daily for a chronic sore foot. Then Dr. Fleming tried acupuncture.     ""She gave the horse one treatment and I would say that within two days he was better. I was flabbergasted. That was a couple of months ago and he's been sound ever since. We've been working him every day.""     But Ms. Powers, who has been a trainer for 25 years, said she doesn't believe acupuncture works in every case. ""I don't totally believe in it for everything,"" she said. ""We tried it on an eye problem and I didn't see any improvement.""     Although the American Veterinary Medical Association didn't recognize acupuncture as a medical specialty until 1988, the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society has offered certification courses for more than 10 years. About 150 veterinarians in the United States have completed the 120-hour course.

A dozen glass orbs the size of cue balls lined his spine, the skin beneath them bulging ruby red as blood was drawn to the surface.While the unusual scene might suggest the man had encountered a freak accident in a light bulb factory, this was actually a treatment he eagerly chose at the Los Gatos Acupuncture and Qigong Center.This is cupping therapy, a millennia-old technique in Chinese medicine -- also employed for decades in the United States under the category of alternative care -- chiefly sought out to relieve aches and pains and increase circulation. Practitioners believe it can increase the movement in the body's own energy, or ""qi."" And it's making news once again, with stars such as Jennifer Aniston, Victoria Beckham, Gwyneth Paltrow and hubby Chris Martin recently sporting the telltale red circles temporarily left behind from treatments. Kelly Osbourne even tweeted out a photo of herself during a cupping session a couple of weeks ago, showing a small glass ball attached to her foot, and adding ""went 2 the most amazing Chinese Dr who fixed me w/ cups.""Everything old ...Acupuncturists and massage therapists who regularly employ the technique smile tolerantly when asked about the ""new"" trend.""Yes, I had to laugh,"" whispered South Bay massage therapist Grant Atwell as gentle sounds of chirping birds and crashing waves played softly in the background of the treatment room where John, who asked that his last name not be used, was being cupped by acupuncturist and clinic founder Adam Atman. ""We see the stars on the red carpet, showing off the discoloration,"" Atwell said. ""It looks like they've been attacked by a friendly octopus.""John offered a muffled agreement about the octopus analogy as he lay on the table on a recent Thursday afternoon. ""Either octopus, or big leeches,"" he mumbled, describing the sensation of the cups sucking at his pale skin. He sought the treatment as a possible cure for hearing loss and blood pressure issues that ail him.""You can see the redness in his back. From a Chinese medical point of view, this indicates too much heat going up his body,"" said Atman, before applying the cups. ""What the cupping does is pull the blood to the surface, pull the heat out of it and vent the stagnant blood. It also lifts the tissue and improves circulation to those areas.""This form of cupping -- one of several versions of the technique -- is considered a traditional style in which specially designed glass vessels are swabbed on the inside with alcohol, then lit with a flame and placed on the skin, the heat creating instant suction. The client is not affected by the flame, merely feeling a warm sensation and a pulling on the skin.A cup of historySome modern devices involve silicone cups, which are more flexible and can be used on joints and many other parts of the body. Cupping is often used in conjunction with other therapies, such as acupuncture or reflexology, Atwell said. He uses cups made of rubber and employs a gliding technique, rather than keeping the cups stationary. Small cups can even be used on the face.The therapy dates back 3,000-plus years, according to Sonia Morton of the International Cupping Therapy Association, or ICTA, based in Washington state. Originally, animal horns, bamboo or even gourds were used for the procedure.""The general idea is negative pressure, rather than tissue compression,"" Morton said. ""The suction lifts the connective tissue, breaks up and drains stagnation while increasing blood and lymph flow to skin and muscles in ways not possible using compression. It's great for pain, repetitive strains, inflammation, toxicity, digestive problems and many other issues.""Educators at the ICTA have indeed seen a growth in interest in the practice during recent years, sometimes even training medical doctors and chiropractors in the technique.""I liken it to hardwood floors versus carpeting, with hardwood being Eastern medicine and carpet as Western,"" Morton said. ""Everyone used to have hardwood floors, then carpet came along and was the trend. But now we're back to hardwood floors again because of the superior benefits.""While reviews of cupping therapy at the National Institutes of Health suggest more rigorous studies are needed for definitive answers as to the efficacy of the practice, some research has indeed indicated benefits for pain relief. And the Mayo Clinic reports some studies show a possible beneficial role for cupping in treating fibromyalgia, but also recommends more research.The marks that often result from a treatment -- which can last from a few hours to a week, depending on skin type and other conditions -- are not bruises, as many believe.""There is no trauma, no broken capillaries,"" Morton said. ""It's from the toxins that come to the surface. The worse the toxicity in a certain area, or the older an injury, the longer the marks will be apparent.""Dhyana Iris, a massage therapist in the East Bay, recently added cupping to her repertoire after falling in love the with effects of the treatments for herself. ""It's a totally delicious experience,"" she said. Iris has adapted an extremely gentle version of the gliding technique to work with older people with chronic illness or with Alzheimer's, or those who are approaching the end of life.Costs of procedures vary depending on the practitioner and on accompanying applications, such as hot-stone massage or reflexology. Iris usually charges about $75 to $100 for a cupping session, but greatly reduces her prices for elderly clients.Don't try this at homeNow don't go rummaging the recycling bin for your empty peanut butter jars. Cupping should only be performed by licensed health care providers. And there are many situations in which even specialists will not perform the treatment, such as if the client has skin infections, fever or diabetes, Atman said.While the cups performed their work on John, Atman moved to another room at the clinic to attend Alexsandra Marianetti, 38, of Campbell, a tantra instructor who goes by the name of Kika. Soon, she had about 26 cups running up and down her back.""Kika has two conditions perfect for cupping -- congestion from a cold, and allergies,"" Atman said.""It feels like someone is placing a kiss on my back,"" Kika said, kidding with Atman as he applied the cups. ""Be sure to give me a nice design.""Follow Angela Hill onTwitter.com/giveemhill , or read her Sunday Give 'Em Hill column.  Cupping therapy was used in Egypt dating back some 3,500 years, even apparent in hieroglyphic writing.  The famous Taoist alchemist and herbalist Ge Hong (A.D. 281""341) was a proponent of cupping.  In ancient Greece, Hippocrates recommended the use of cups for a variety of ailments.  In the early 1900s, British physician Sir Arthur Keith wrote about witnessing cupping performed ""with excellent success.""  In China, extensive research has been carried out on the technique, and even today the practice continues to be a mainstay of government-sponsored hospitals in traditional Chinese medicine.Source: International Cupping Therapy Association,www.cuppingtherapy.org .Cups attached to the back of Alexsandra Marianetti, of Campbell, who is being treated for a cold and allergies at Los Gatos Acupuncture and Qigong Center in Los Gatos, Calif. on Thursday, May 9, 2013.

Accreditation means students now can apply for government financial assistance and can transfer college credits to other accredited universities.""It's a significant achievement for the school,"" said Jenty Hasan, a university spokeswoman. ""The students are very excited. It opens the door for students to all kinds of things.""The master's program at the university provides graduate education for the training of practitioners in traditional Chinese medicine. The university also offers courses in integrating Western medical sciences with traditional Chinese medicine."
13,1014.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Chinese medicine enters mainstream;Prescription herbs, acupuncture emerge as pain-relief alternative","For decades, doctors in America have prescribed pills for pain -- white ones, blue ones, big ones, new ones.And for centuries, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have eased aches, strains and spasms through herbal remedies and acupuncture.Although acupuncture's needles have filtered into mainstream Western medicine, the secrets of the Eastern herb world remain unknown to most of America's pharmaceutical companies.Dr. Young Soon Chung keeps several such secrets stored at the back of her bright white office, tucked away in an office complex off busy Hesperian Boulevard. After studying both Western and Eastern medicine in San Francisco and Korea, Chung decided to prescribe herbs in the ancient way. The goal, as always in Chinese medicine, is balance, she said, adding a finger point. ""When we are sick, our body's balance is off. For instance, heat will consume all your water, but if you regulate your chi level, you will reduce the heat,"" she said, referring to ""chi"" -- a Chinese measurement of the oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and overall energy flow through the human body.Indeed, the entire theory of traditional Chinese medicine is based on the balance of two opposing yet interdependent forces -- yin and yang. The ancient Chinese used water and fire to symbolize yin and yang -- anything moving, hot, bright and hyperactive is yang, while anything calm, cool, dim and hypoactive is yin. Each organ contains a level of yin and yang, and the traditional Chinese medic's job is to coax a balance between the two elements.As Chung mixes an herbal remedy to relieve migraine headaches, she surrounds the most potent estrogen-containing herb -- dong quai -- with sprinklings of other roots. Later she will brew the brownish mixture into a tea for her patient Yan Hayes.Hayes drinks the dong quai concoction and receives acupuncture to help relieve her migraine headaches. She says that after trying countless Western pain killers, she finally listened to her mother, who told her to follow the traditions of Laos, their homeland.""Every time I used to get migraines I would have to stay in my room -- even my kids couldn't be in the same room,"" Hayes said as Chung slightly pierced her ear with tiny needles. ""The pain medicines my doctor gave me weren't working. I came here and got better; even my doctor couldn't believe it.""Meanwhile, other American companies have taken a different approach to dong quai, which entered the realm of Western scientific study in 1997. By leaching out the most potent chemicals from the root, they magnify the root's normal strength. Some of the new dong quai products such as Endow Plus for Women promise to boost bra size, while others, such as MenopauseSmart from HealthWorldOnline, say dong quai will tame menopausal hot flashes.But Chung warns that concentrating the herb to such high levels strains the liver, kidney and stomach.""There is a belief throughout homeopathic medicine that the mega-dose ends up killing the patient,"" she said. ""If you give them the right dose, you can cure the condition without having side effects on other organs.""However, while Chung believes Chinese medicine provides a healthier approach to curing chronic ailments such as migraine headaches and back pain, she said Western medicine is far superior during emergency situations.""When you have an acute problem or infection, you can't fool around with a slow process,"" she said, giving the example of a patient who is severely dehydrated.Other situations call for a combination of both Western and Eastern practices, such as when cancer patients go through chemotherapy, Chung said.""They need chemotherapy, but it will deplete their energy,"" Chung said. ""Acupuncture can help control the side effects of nausea, and herbs can help to reduce the toxins in the cancer patient's body.""To contact Dr. Chung, call [510] 887-7697 or visit www.chungsacupuncture.com"
14,1015.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Acupuncture, herbs displayed at health fair;MANY IN BAY AREA USE CHINESE MEDICINE AS PART OF THEIR PRIMARY HEALTH CARE","Today's Chinese Medicine Health Fair at the Five Branches Institute in Santa Cruz will offer tea and herbs, acupuncture and lectures. It also offers a peek at what for an increasing number of people is becoming primary health care: a 5,000-year-old system that claims to maintain health by correcting balances within the body.At Five Branches, said founder Ron Zaidman, ''We asked people who their primary medical provider was, and 85 percent of them said their acupuncturist.''An inquiry among people at a clinic that practices traditional Chinese medicine is hardly an unbiased sample. But neither is it what Zaidman expected to hear, he said. It may be suggestive of a profound shift in people's attitudes toward medicine, or it may be just, well, Santa Cruz. Or California. ''We're a funny state,'' said Catherine Dower, an attorney who works in the health field. ''Acupuncture is pretty popular, and it is a large profession in this state.'' Dower is associate director for health law and policy at the Center for the Health Professions, an agency of the University of California-San Francisco medical center.Approximately 4,300 people hold acupuncture licenses in California. That number is estimated to be half the total number in the United States, but it does not include holders of other medical licenses, primarily physicians and chiropractors, who also perform acupuncture.On the one hand, said Dower, ''There are a lot of people using Chinese medicine for their primary care.'' And on the other hand, she cautioned, ''No one's done any real good data collection on consumer usage of alternative therapies.''Here are some figures:  The Five Branches clinic averages about 100 patients a day, according to Zaidman. They come for acupuncture, herbs, Chinese or Tibetan massage, or other treatments by the faculty and interns.  Nine percent of all Americans have had acupuncture at one time or another, according to a Harris Interactive survey commissioned by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. A majority of those people, 58 percent, sought treatment for disorders ''of the bones, muscles, joints and nervous system.''Half of those surveyed said they'd try it if their doctors recommended it and their insurance covered it. Some insurance does, in California. And some physicians not only recommend it but also perform it.The medical schools at UCLA, the University of Southern California and Harvard all offer intensive programs in it, although legally in California a physician can perform acupuncture without any training. In fact, said Dr. Dawn Motyka, a Scotts Valley physician who uses acupuncture, a physician could pick up enough acupuncture at a weekend seminar to perform some basic first-aid procedures.In her family practice, she may use acupuncture for ''chronic pain, tendinitis, headaches, irritable bowel -- the sorts of things where I really don't have good drugs for it or the drugs that I have have significant downsides.''She sees acupuncture as an augmentation of the ''linear'' Western way of thinking about how medicine works, what she calls the ''cut-this-out-and-see-what-goes-wrong'' approach.Motyka, who has gone through the UCLA program and expects to become board-certified in acupuncture this spring, says she practices ''European style'' acupuncture, which uses electrical stimulation through the needles, as opposed to Chinese style, which relies on the insertion and the manipulation of needles alone to stimulate the body's acupuncture points.Zaidman, 59, a Stanford MBA who did business in Europe and his native Venezuela before settling on Santa Cruz, founded Five Branches in 1984. That makes it one of the oldest of the country's 45 schools of traditional Chinese medicine, he said. His faculty members are primarily Asian, and his students, mostly in their 30s and seeking a career change, are overwhelmingly white.They spend three to four years at the school, whose offices, treatment rooms and herb center occupy the ground floor of an office building near the Santa Cruz harbor. It's a master's degree program that includes courses in Western medicine and Chinese language and culture as well as the ''five branches'' -- acupuncture, herbs, Chinese massage, QiGong (described as ''energetics and exercises'') and diet.Motyka says that the sort of traditional Chinese medicine taught and practiced at schools like Five Branches derives from the need, following China's Cultural Revolution in the 1970s and '80s, to train rudimentary practitioners quickly. She calls it ''the Cliff's Notes version of the ancient Chinese texts.''The Chinese may speak of the flow of Chi, while the French, leaders in European acupuncture research, may speak of electricity.

15,1016.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"IN FIGHT AGAINST SARS, CHINA RELIES ON TRADITION;HERBAL TREATMENTS, WESTERN MEDICINE ARE WIDELY PAIRED","In its fight against a new virus, China is relying on an old style of medicine.Traditional Chinese medicine, which has theories and remedies that date back thousands of years, is playing a key role in the battle against severe acute respiratory syndrome, both as a preventive measure and a treatment.Across China, the epicenter of the global SARS epidemic, millions of people are consuming herbal potions formulated to boost their immune systems, to ward off infection by the virus.And in hospitals throughout the country, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine armed with acupuncture needles and herbal remedies work alongside doctors trained in Western medicine to try to save the lives and shorten the recoveries of the more than 5,000 Chinese who have been stricken by the SARS virus. No medicine from either system has been proven effective against SARS. But Dr. He Puren, an acupuncturist at the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said a combination was thought to give patients the best chances of recovery.He and other traditional-medicine practitioners said early indications were promising. They cite the experience of No. 1 Hospital of the Guangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine University, which is in the capital of China's southern Guangdong province, where the SARS epidemic is believed to have started last November.Fang Ning, a hospital official, said Wednesday that it had treated 56 SARS patients since the first one appeared in mid-January. None has died, 52 have recovered, and the four remaining patients are well on their way to recovering, he said.Fang added that no hospital staff had been infected, a significant achievement in an epidemic in which nearly 20 percent of hospitalized patients have been medical workers.Western medicine is used at the hospital, too, but the emphasis is on Chinese medicine.In Beijing, most hospitals that treat SARS patients use the steroids and antibiotics of Western medicine along with Chinese traditional remedies, said He, the acupuncturist.Zhang Mao, a vice mayor of Beijing and head of the medical-care team of the city's SARS task force, said the city's 26 Chinese traditional-medicine hospitals and more than 3,000 doctors who specialize in traditional medicine were making a major contribution to the fight against SARS.Traditional medicine ""may actually offer something very helpful that Western medicine should know about and use,"" said Dr. James Maguire, an infectious-disease specialist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta who is on a WHO team of experts in Beijing.But making a scientific assessment of traditional Chinese medicine's effectiveness in treating SARS will not be easy, Maguire said, in part because it almost always is used in combination with Western medicine, and treatments tend to be highly individualized.A man with a headache who goes to a Western doctor may be told to take an aspirin, for example. If he goes to a traditional Chinese practitioner, he probably will end up with an herbal remedy or acupuncture treatment that takes into account his gender, age, general condition and the season of the year.""We treat the human being rather than the disease,"" said Dr. Albert Leung, a faculty member of the School of Chinese Medicine at Hong Kong's Baptist University and a leader in the successful push to include traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of SARS patients in Hong Kong's hospitals.Leung acknowledged that ""it is very difficult to prove whether it works or not."" But he said he and other traditional practitioners were confident that their ancient knowledge could be effective.""We care how the symptoms are presented, and treat accordingly,"" he said.Yin and yang are the two fundamental principles of Chinese cosmology, and they underpin traditional-medicine theory. Yin is negative. Yang is positive. Only when the yin and yang forces within the body are balanced can qi, or vital energy, flow freely, according to that theory.This theory also holds that the human body is crisscrossed with invisible channels through which qi flows, much the way blood flows through arteries andveins. An unimpeded flow of strong qi is the definition of health.Most Chinese believe in the existence of this system. On the windowsill of the Beijing vice mayor's office, this invisible world is represented by a road map of qi channels that cover the shiny white surface of a plastic man.""Chinese medicine can reduce the heat, smooth the qi and get rid of the poison,"" Zhang said.PHOTO: MIRANDA MIMI KUO -- KNIGHT RIDDERA pharmacist at Beijing's White Temple Pharmacy on Tuesday prepares packages of traditional herbs for use against SARS."
16,1017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NEW CAMPUS SYMBOLIZES ACCEPTANCE,"When Ron Zaidman and Joanna Zhao opened Five Branches, a school and clinic for traditional Chinese medicine in Santa Cruz 20 years ago, acupuncture was all but called quackery.""If I had told somebody 20 years ago that I'd had acupuncture treatment, it wouldn't have been called voodoo but it was considered not far removed from it,"" said Zaidman.""But now, nobody would be surprised. It's not that far out,"" he said. Later this month, Zaidman and his wife, Zhao, will welcome the first students of a new branch of their clinic and school in San Jose, testament to how much the field of alternative and complementary medicine has grown in the Bay Area and the country. It's also a sign, some industry experts say, of the increasing integration of traditional practices of medicine, like acupuncture, into Western culture.Five Branches is one of the oldest such schools in Northern California, and one of six in the Bay Area. Ten others are located in Los Angeles and San Diego.""I can tell that things have changed based on my conversations with neighbors,"" said Yu-Wen Chiu, director of the San Jose campus of Five Branches.""When I was in school and I once told my neighbors I was studying acupuncture, the response was, 'Oh, that's interesting. I've never heard about that.'""Now, when I tell my neighbors what I do, they know,"" Chiu said.On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Zhao, the college's academic dean and clinic director, gave visitors a tour of the new school at 3031 Tisch Way, near Santana Row.The school will start out with one classroom, 20 students and an eight-room clinic.""We're hoping this school will be bigger than the one in Santa Cruz,"" Zhao said.Five Branches in Santa Cruz started in a single classroom with 18 students and a small clinic. Today, the college, which offers a four-year master's degree in traditional Chinese medicine, has 200 students and sees about 100 patients a day. There were five instructors in the first year; today there are 37, including 20 licensed acupuncturists and seven physicians. One third of the curriculum is devoted to Western medicine, Zhao said.Zaidman said the move to San Jose is in response to the growing demand for practitioners of acupuncture and herbal medicine, traditions that date back 2,000 years in China. The practice first found an audience in the United States in the 1960s, but it wasn't until 1979 that California began licensing acupuncturists -- the first state to do so.Since then, Zaidman said, much has changed in how traditional Chinese medicine is viewed. Now, the state of California has an Acupuncture Board, a government body that oversees regulation of schools like Five Branches and licensing of acupuncturists. Most health insurance companies, Medi-Cal -- state-sponsored insurance for indigent and low-income people -- and worker's compensation accept acupuncture treatment.Some Bay Area hospitals have integrated acupuncture into their practices.The National Institutes of Health recently released the findings of an important study showing that acupuncture relieved the pain of people with arthritic knees.What's more, there is now a government-recognized group that oversees accreditation of professional training programs in acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. The group, based in Maryland, is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.""When we started, the Department of Education considered us a vocational school,"" Zaidman said. ""We argued this is serious, on the level of a doctorate or master's degree program.""The school's demographics have also changed over the years. In the early years of Five Branches, most of its students were people seeking alternatives to Western medicine.These days, many of the students are young college students looking to start professional careers in the field, or people switching careers.Marlene Griffith-Aunko, 31, of Montara, is in tech support for a Bay Area biotech company, but when she finishes her final year at Five Branches in another year, she's going to practice traditional Chinese medicine full time.Griffith-Aunko was rear-ended by a drunken driver in a 1998 car accident and suffered serious back injury. Only acupuncture, she said, helped get rid of the pain.""I've had an interest in health and science for a long time,"" she said. So when she started getting acupuncture treatments, she also began working as a receptionist and scheduler for a Menlo Park acupuncturist.Going into her fourth year of training, Griffith-Aunko said she's delighted to be finishing her clinical training at the new San Jose campus.""I'll still commute,"" she said, ""but I have a lot more friends to see near San Jose.""Will Morris, president of the American Association of Oriental Medicine, the industry group for practitioners, said the expansion of Five Branches into San Jose ""is emblematic of the acceptance of this medicine in this culture.""""I see it as a smart business move on the part of the school,"" Morris said. ""The fact that they have the economics to support this is also evidence in this direction of the full acceptance of this particular medicine.""DIAGRAM: MERCURY NEWSKEY POINTS: Acupuncture students study the flow of energy through the body.PHOTO: PATRICK TEHAN - MERCURY NEWSLicensed acupuncturist Susana Shen inserts needles into a man's painful knees at the Five Branches Institute's new school and clinic in San Jose.

17,1018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0, Take one rhino horn with meals,"  Threatened species are facing extinction for dubious Chinese cures, writes Richard Ellis I used to think that practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine made extensive use of acupuncture and herbal concoctions -if I thought about animals at all it was only in the belief that their parts played a small role. I was, therefore, startled to find that rhinos, tigers and bears are being killed for traditional Chinese medicine in such numbers that their existence is threatened. A century ago, there were an estimated one million black rhinos in Africa; there are now perhaps 2,500. At the turn of the 20th century, there may have been 100,000 tigers in India; there are now fewer than 5,000. As many as 10,000 bears are kept in squeeze cages on ""bear farms"" in China, with steel catheters inserted into their gall bladders to drain off the bile. When the bears outlive their usefulness, they are killed. North and South American bears are also being killed for their gall bladders, which are then smuggled into China. There are five species of rhinoceros three in Asia and two in Africa -and all are being slaughtered for their horns, which, when ground into a powder, are said to cure a variety of ailments. Tigers, endangered throughout their range, are killed for their bones, which are made into a ""tiger-bone wine"" or soup that is said to give the drinker the sexual stamina of the tiger.  The driving force behind animal poaching is not medicinal but monetary. To a poor herdsman in India, an animal passing by that might be worth $ 10,000 is an irresistible temptation. The parts of these animals are worth a fortune to middlemen, and are even more valuable to the purchasers of the medicines. Ground rhino horn is one of the most valuable natural substances in the world. As long as users are willing to pay astronomical prices for bones, powdered horn or bear gall, poachers will continue to slaughter the animals. While plants can be picked, leaves plucked, fruits, vegetables, and nuts harvested, and seeds collected without threatening the species, some animals must be killed so that the valuable parts can be harvested for use in Chinese medicine. The bones or skin of a tiger or the gall bladder of a bear cannot be removed without killing the animal, and while some clever entrepreneurs have figured out how to obtain bear gall from a living bear, the technique is so awful that death for the bear might be preferable. It is possible to anaesthetise a rhino and saw its horn off, but it is a difficult, cumbersome, and dangerous process that might result in the death of the rhino anyway, so poachers take the easier path and simply shoot the animal. In the not-so-distant past, people such as Ernest Hemingway hunted rhinos for the thrill of shooting a large animal with a powerful gun from a great distance. The animals' stuffed heads were hung on the wall and their feet turned into umbrella stands, but overall demand for such trophies was modest. In reality, most rhinos dying at the hand of man during the past century were killed to meet medicinal demand for their horns, with a substantial number being killed for dagger (jambiya) handles in Yemen. The three Asian rhino species -Indian, Javan and Sumatran -were the first to go, hunted almost to extinction, but the horn of the African black rhino, highly prized for carving dagger handles, is also sought. The seemingly innocuous pursuit of carving dagger handles has brought the black rhino to such low levels that its existence is threatened too. Where once there were eight subspecies of tigers in Asia, there are now five, and three of these are close to extinction. They are being hunted because traditional Chinese medicine needs the bones, flesh, fat, eyeballs, teeth and claws, and fashion needs the pelts. Most medicinals prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine are of a vegetable or herbal origin; only a few originate in animal parts. Of these, many are from domestic animals such as pigs, cows, horses, camels, goats and sheep. But a few come from wild animals, such as lions, leopards, deer, monkeys, otters and beavers. I am not offering a blanket criticism of the principles or practices of traditional Chinese medicine, but rather I am pointing out that some irresponsible people, often perverting the fundamentals of this venerable tradition, carry a large responsibility for the destruction of some increasingly endangered species. It is a terrible anachronism that so many people today rely on largely ineffectual animal-related remedies, but the real tragedy is that large numbers of animals have to die to provide these nostrums. There are millions of people in China, South-East Asia, and elsewhere with little access to education on science. They are therefore ignorant of the composition of the potions they so eagerly consume and they know little about the endangerment of animals. A wider understanding of the traditions, the medications, and the status of the endangered species might possibly save even more lives -human and animal. Tigers and rhinos are heading for extinction, perhaps in our lifetime, almost certainly in the lifetime of our children's children. They will certainly know what a tiger is -we live in an age of eternally preserved video images -and all those tigers in cages, zoos and circuses will ensure that these powerful cats will not be relegated to the trash bin, like the dodo or the passenger pigeon. In The Outermost House, Henry Beston wrote: ""We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature, and living by complicated artifice, man in civilisation surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion."" Surely the most distorted image it is possible to conjure is that animals were put here for our use. Domestication for food is easy to rationalise -it will be a long time before people stop eating cows or chickens -and the use of oxen, camels, or buffalos as beasts of burden is not likely to cease until Third World agriculturalists obtain inexpensive internal combustion engines. But enlightened human beings, even those who have used animal parts for medicine for thousands of years, should recognise that most of these nostrums are only primitive superstitions, and more critically, that the animals providing these often useless pharmaceuticals are becoming extinct. There are arguments to be made -not all of them convincing -that it is necessary (and morally acceptable) to use animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, or monkeys in tests that might have beneficial applications for human medical needs. These animals are sacrificed for a ""higher purpose"", namely the production and testing of vaccines, hormone preparations or even cosmetics. The number of laboratory mice and rats that die every year in the name of medical research must be astronomical. Within the precepts of Chinese medicine, however, some animals are killed to provide what practitioners are convinced are cures for ailing people, or people who might be sexually dysfunctional. In many cases, these prescriptions do not work, or do not work as well as some synthetic pharmaceuticals. But it is not, after all, the use of animal parts per se that is the problem -it is the slaughter of the animals for what might be specious applications, or worse, the slaughter of critically endangered species. Richard Ellis is the author of Tiger Bone and Rhino Horn: The Destruction of Wildlife for Traditional Chinese Medicine, to be published in June by Island Press ON THE CRITICAL LIST Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris); number thought to survive: 4,000 Amur (Siberian) tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), 450 Almost every body part of the tiger -teeth, claws, bones, fat, eyeballs -is used in Chinese medicine. Most of the uses have to do with increasing virility; to somehow transfer the strength and savagery of the tiger to men whose sexual prowess needs enhancing. And, of course, the beautiful striped coat of the tiger is valuable for non-medical reasons. African black rhino (Diceros bicornis), 2,500 Northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), 100 Indian rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis), 2,400 Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), 50 Javan rhino (Rhinoceros sondaicus), 100 It is only the horn (and sometimes the toenails) of rhinos that are used. In Yemen, the horns are carved into dagger handles that are worn by young men upon achieving manhood. Ground rhino horn is not used as an aphrodisiac, but is prescribed for everything from headache and toothache to infertility and fevers. Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), 10,000 in ""squeeze"" cages in China. Bear gall (bile) is used for a variety of ailments, but especially gall and kidney stones, stomach ache, and fevers. (The bears are not killed until their gall bladders run dry of bile.) In all cases, numbers are estimates."

Serious runners will leave no stone unturned in their quest for speed, and the latest trend is acupuncture to ease weary limbs, niggling injuries and post-race fatigue. According to the ancient theories of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is vital in clearing blockages and helping to balance the body's yin and yang, as imbalances manifest themselves as illness or pain. It involves practitioners placing a thin, disposable needle into one of more than 2,000 specific points on the body. Who's it aimed at? Any of the 40,000 runners preparing to cover the 26.2 miles from Greenwich to the Mall in the Flora London Marathon next Saturday.What's the idea? It is thought that the needles stimulate the brain to release endorphins, boosting mood and relieving tiredness, and trigger the immune system to help to ward off injuries, soreness and joint pain. Several small studies have suggested that it works for runners. One published last year in the journal Chinese Medicine found ""significant differences"" in muscle soreness among those who had acupuncture during an exhaustive training regimen compared with those who didn't.Who uses it? The marathon superwoman, Paula Radcliffe, admits to being a fan. Athletes in other sports, including the tennis player Maria Sharapova, also use it.Can I try it? In the wrong hands, acupuncture can be risky, so make sure your practitioner is registered with the British Acupuncture Council (BAcC). To find someone who is experienced at treating sports people, visit its website, acupuncture.org.uk, or call 020-8735 0400. According to theBAcC spokeswoman Charlotte McNeil, you will need a couple of sessions a week if you are injured. For healthy runners, acupuncture before and after the marathon will help to restore some normality to your body. Expect to pay around �40-�60 per session.Is it worth the money? If it helps to prevent your muscles from turning to concrete in the days after the race, then bring on the needles..'' The marathon superwoman Paula Radcliffe admits to being a fan of acupuncture"
19,1020.0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Bad medicine?,"  Some alternative remedies have been questioned by the House of Lords. Are they right? We ask a specialist and three patients Traditional Chinese medicine combines herbs, acupuncture, massage and exercise techniques.For: Musician Andrew Golden, 47. decided to look for an alternative remedy for his psoriasis after giving up the drug that his GP had prescribed. ""I have suffered from psoriasis on my hands for years. In the past I'd gone to see my GP who prescribed Betnovate, which did sort it out. It was only when I discovered that the drug was carcinogenic that I decided to stop using it. I didn't want to go back to my GP and yet I didn't know what else to do. I'm a drummer in a band and I had a tour coming up - psoriasis is a stress thing for me and it got really bad, affecting my ability to play the drums. I decided to go to the Institute of Chinese Medicine in Chandos Place in London. One of its doctors had already cured me of back pain using acupuncture.  ""The doctor I saw told me that she could cure my psoriasis, which surprised me because I didn't think there was a cure. I was given some lotion, along with some ghastly herbs, which I had to boil and drink. It worked very well, I'm not 'cured' but I blame myself for that - I think if I'd finished the course of treatment I was prescribed, it would have disappeared completely."" Against: Dr Graham Lord, a kidney specialist at the Hammersmith Hospital, published a paper in The Lancet in August last year which reported the cases of two women who had suffered kidney failure after taking Chinese herbal remedies for eczema. ""More than 3,000 UK clinics now prescribe herbal remedies. In the cases of these women, a few years after starting the herbal treatment they developed rapidly progressive kidney failure and both needed dialysis. One has since had a kidney transplant and the other is still on the NHS waiting list. ""The woman who has had the transplant went to see her GP because of sudden headaches and high blood pressure. Tests were done and she was found to have severe kidney failure. ""I arranged for analysis of the herbs with colleagues at Kew Gardens and we found that both women had been exposed to a toxic chemical called Aristolochic acid. The import, sale and use of this acid, which may be a component of a number of Chinese remedies, has now been banned by the Medicines Control Agency. It is unclear how successful the ban is. I advise anyone who sees a Chinese herbalist to ask them whether there is Aristochic acid in the preparation and see their GP immediately if they feel unwell while taking any remedies."" Kinesiology is muscle testing using acupuncture principles to assess ""imbalances in the body"". For: Lucy McCann, 33, an events organiser from London, suffered digestive and irritable bowel problems for several years. She visited an applied kinesiologist as a final attempt for a cure. ""Some days I was in agony with my stomach, others it was just a niggle, but I decided that I wanted it sorted out. I play a lot of sport and it was interfering with my fitness and social life. I had tried to cut out foods I thought might upset my system, but to no avail. The kinesiologist I saw assessed my lifestyle and diet and tested my muscles to work out my nutritional status. ""Dairy foods, yeast, bread and mushrooms seemed to be the biggest offenders and I was prescribed desensitisers and vitamins to strengthen my immune system. On my second and third visits the therapist, a qualified osteopath, used manipulation and massage to stimulate blood circulation and help balance my emotions. Within days of excluding the foods, the pain in my stomach subsided, my energy levels rocketed and my attitude chan-ged. I now visit the kinesiologist every six months and she is reintroducing some of the foods to my diet with no ill-effect."" Against: Ellen Sims, a 38-year-old teacher from Somerset, is concerned that people who are desperately searching for a cure could be put at risk from placing all their faith in some alternative treatments. ""I am convinced that some alternative and complementary medicine works, but was struck by the pseudo-science of a kinesiologist I saw. I did not go for treatment for a specific problem, but to find out more, and I found it very flaky and unconvincing. ""The kind of stretching, bending and organ massage that makes up some kinesiology sessions could be pleasant, and even offers symptomatic relief from some problems. The danger arises if you take this as curative, or are not being treated by someone with the skills and knowledge to diagnose the underlying problem, and this then gets ignored. If you've paid Pounds 40 or so for a session, and you're desperate to get better, you might be persuaded to suspend your disbelief."" Against: Anita Morgan, 28, a writer from Kent, visited an applied kinesiologist when she suffered repeated bouts of skin rashes on her face and body. ""My skin had always been fairly sensitive, but I began to get unsightly rashes appearing regularly on my face, back and stomach. Someone told me it might be an allergy and that the best way to determine its cause was to visit an applied kinesiologist. ""The therapist I saw agreed that I was probably intolerant to some foods and tested for more than 100 different sensitivities by holding a sample of each next to my stomach and then applying pressure to my arm. The theory is that if you can't resist and your arm gives way, you have an intolerance to that substance. After that session I was told I should avoid 32 of the foods including tea, coffee, sugar and milk. ""That initial consultation cost Pounds 90 plus Pounds 8 for each vial of desensitiser. I stuck rigidly to what she suggested, but three months and several follow-up consultations at Pounds 60 each, later my rash was occurring more frequently. On a visit to my doctor, it happened to be particularly severe and he suggested I go to the hospital for a skin-prick allergy test. There, I was told I have a severe allergy to citrus fruits and pineapple, which I was eating frequently - something the kinesiologist hadn't picked up on at all. As soon as I cut them out, my rash disappeared. I feel kinesiology was a waste of money and a ruthless way to prey on someone's ill health and insecurities."""
20,1021.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Has the East lost its healing touch?; Why is traditional Chinese medicine under threat both here and in China, asks John Naish","Before anyone accuses me of prejudice, I would like to say that I do have sympathy for a balanced, holistic oriental approach to wellbeing. But as a health journalist with 20 years' experience, the popularity of Chinese medicine and its lack of regulation fill me with alarm.I decided to test my concerns by consulting three Chinese herbal-medicine practitioners, all only five minutes' walk from my home in Brighton. At each, I complained of fatigue and bloatedness (symptoms I attribute to being a man in his forties). The first tested my pulse, looked at my tongue and asked about my symptoms. She pronounced that my body was contaminated by a cold I'd had five months ago, and that my energy channels were blocked. She wanted to charge �88 for herbs, pills, acupuncture and massage. The second charged �10 for a consultation in which he examined my blood pressure. He said that I suffered ""weak kidney energy"" and an excess of damp in my stomach, and prescribed a two-week course of herbs for �17 and a �150 course of acupuncture. In the third consultation, the practitioner pronounced that I had ""spleen insufficiency and weak pulse"". He wanted �325 for herbs, pills and acupuncture.He was the only one to require my GP's address or to ask if I was taking Western medications - crucial information as components in Chinese medicine can interact dangerously with conventional drugs. None of the practitioners would discuss their medicines' ingredients. It's this sort of apparent randomness that has British lobbying organisations such as Sense About Science - a charitable trust run by academics and scientists - arguing that Chinese herbalism should not be defined as ""medicine"", as it gives many practitioners a credibility that they do not merit. Yet about 6,000 Chinese herbal medicine stores have sprung up on the high streets of Britain in recent years, a popularity that might suggest that they are in rude health.But Chinese medicine is threatened here and in its home country. When its record of selling potentially poisonous ""cures"" and making wild diagnoses is examined, this might not seem surprising. The dangers of dodgy Chinese medicine were highlighted in a trial at the Old Bailey last month. Patricia Booth, a civil servant, told how ""safe and natural"" pills she bought for a skin complaint from the Chinese Herbal Medical Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, destroyed her kidneys and caused her to develop cancer. The pills contained aristolochic acid, which is carcinogenic. Booth, 58, is now housebound. The practitioner, who admitted prescribing the pills, was given a conditional discharge.Is aristolochic acid off our streets? Apparently not. The Government's drug-safety agency, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is pursuing two cases involving the substance. The agency has investigated other cases in which patients have fallen ill or died after being sold Chinese concoctions containing illegal substances, such as powerful Western medicines, poisonous plants, heavy metals and asbestos.The MHRA says that there is ""no entirely reliable way of telling whether a traditional Chinese medicine is safe"" because ""standards of safety, quality and product information are so erratic"". Chinese medicine also faces growing scepticism in its homeland. The China Daily reports that only one fifth of patients there now use it. China has 270,000 traditional doctors today compared with 800,000 in the early 20th century. In recent years the Government has invested heavily in Western medicine - often used in conjunction with traditional therapies - and this has brought improvements in life expectancy and childbirth mortality.In 2006, Zhang Gongyao, a professor at Central South University, Hunan, launched an online campaign against traditional medicine, claiming that it lacked ""a rational foundation"" and used ""poisons and waste"" for cures. Such protests may grow as social change sweeps China. Today's traditional Chinese medicine was systematised in the 1950s under Mao Zedong to prove that China had no need to rely on Western technology. An army of herbalist ""barefoot doctors"" was more affordable, too. But Dr Li Zhisui Li, Mao's personal physician for 20 years, revealed in The Private Life of Chairman Mao that Mao extolled Chinese medicine only in public. Privately, he used Western cures. Chinese medicines can have powerful effects, though, and Western drug companies and academics are collaborating with herbalists to find the active chemicals involved. For example, Australian scientists are working with the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine to use lupin extract to treat diabetes.Meanwhile, the European Union is reining in Chinese herbs. Under EU rules that must be enforced in Britain by 2011, all herbs sold will be registered and inspected. The rules ban unregulated practitioners from commissioning or formulating their own medicines. This would effectively put thousands of Chinese herbalists out of business, says Emma Farrant, the secretary of the 450-member Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine.Both Farrant's organisation and the Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine want the Government to regulate their members. The Department of Health is on its second consultation process on this issue - the results will be published ""as soon as possible"". But Sense About Science is lobbying against this, saying that herbalists should be regulated as health professionals only if they can prove that their therapies work in Western drug trials.David Colquhoun, Professor of Pharmacology at University College London, who described Chinese medicine as ""baloney"" in the British Medical Journal last year, supports this: ""You cannot start to think about a sensible form of regulation unless you first decide whether or not the thing you are trying to regulate is nonsense."" Sense About Science also wants rules requiring Chinese herbalists to have Western medical training.Such moves could effectively stamp out traditional Chinese medicine in Britain. That would be a pity for the thousands of patients who believe that it helps their conditions. It may also force therapists underground, where dodgy herbalism could run riot."

Andy Burnham, the Health Secretary, said he was ""minded to legislate"" so that all providers of unlicensed medicines had to register with a regulator. The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council will ensure that practitioners are properly trained and operating a safe business. A pilot study is also planned to analyse how acupuncture could be used within the NHS to help conditions such as lower back pain. Critics say that the proposals, due to be implemented later this year, do not go far enough.It is estimated that Britons spend about �1.6 billion a year on alternative and complementary remedies, with one in five people having tried the medicines or therapies.The CNHC, the only regulatory body for complementary healthcare that has official government backing, currently issues ""charter marks"" to registered practitioners of 11 therapies, including massage, aromatherapy and yoga.To be accepted by the council, those providing unlicensed herbal medicines will have to show that they have the right training and experience, abide by a code of conduct and have insurance in place. From next year, European law will permit only statutorily registered professionals to prescribe manufactured herbal remedies. But clinics or practitioners will not be judged on whether the therapies they provide are effective. Mr Burnham said: ""Emerging evidence clearly demonstrates that the public needs better protection, but in a way that does not place unreasonable extra burdens on practitioners."" The Department of Health said that proposals for those providing acupuncture are still being considered, but a pilot study is due to begin this year.Regulators recently issued warnings about herbal products containing aristolochia, a banned toxic and carcinogenic plant derivative. Packs of the herbal medicine Jingzhi Kesou Tan Chuan Wan are thought to be circulating despite a recall by the distributor.Edzard Ernst, Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter's Peninsula Medical School, said that he had some concerns about the proposals. ""All healthcare professionals regulated in the UK have the proviso that they administer evidence-based medicine. If there is an exemption for those providing herbal medicines it would set a double standard that could be very detrimental."""
23,1024.0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,Where does all the extra NHS funding go?," Sir, Alice Miles describes the report that I chaired on acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems practised in the UK as twaddle. She is entitled to her view but it is ill informed.     Our conclusions echo those of the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology's Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2000), the Government response (2001) and a Department of Health consultation on regulation of these professions (2004, 2005) all of which supported statutory regulation. Moreover, our recommendations have taken account of the most recent regulatory policy introduced to protect patients.    The NHS funds very little complementary and alternative medicine and NHS resources should only be used where there is evidence of efficacy, safety and quality assurance. Some of the therapies, including acupuncture, are used by orthodox healthcare professionals. Contrary to what is implied, neither the Prince of Wales nor the alternative health industry had any input into the report. There is honest recognition that the evidence base for many therapies is thin but, given the public demand for treatment, this should be addressed alongside the introduction of statutory regulation and not as a prerequisite.    Miles argues that the NHS should provide medical, dental and nursing care but absolutely nothing else. What about all the other health professionals such as radiographers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists ? I would be the first to admit that extreme views exist among some advocates of complementary medicine but clearly they are not alone.    PROFESSOR MIKE PITTILO Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen "
24,1025.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0, The value of alternative therapies,"  From Mr Gabriel Mojay Sir, The Lords select committee report on alternative therapies betrays a contradictory and ill- informed assessment of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is contradictory because, while the report affirms that there is scientific evidence for acupuncture and herbal medicine, it finds none for TCM - and yet these two modalities form the very basis of TCM.  The select committee is ill-informed because there is a vast amount of pharmacological and clinical research into the therapeutic properties of Chi- nese herbs, which in any case contain many of the same active compounds as found in Western pharmacopoeias. It should revise its classification of both Chinese herbal medicine and TCM without delay. Yours faithfully, GABRIEL MOJAY, 35 California Road, Mistley, Essex CO11 1JA. November 29."
25,1026.0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0, Chinese doctors return to roots,"  FOR Pounds 37 a head, patients at the Traditional Medicine Hospital in Beijing can have a massage, acupuncture and dinner cooked with herbal remedies in the hospital canteen. Alternatively, they can embalm themselves with oyster shells before tucking into a snack from their private fridges. The hospital is catering for a growing demand, both domestic and international, for the return to traditional Chinese medicine.  Since childhood, Xiao Huang, 35, a former bank clerk, has suffered from chronic chest pains. She is one of millions of Chinese who have rediscovered the benefits of traditional medicine. She recently switched from a Westerneducated doctor to a herbal specialist who prescribed remedies that cured her. ""I used to be too impatient to wait for the slower results of traditional Chinese medicine, but since I lost my job I have a lot more time,"" she said. Traditional chinese medicine (TCM) is booming both in China and in the West, driven by clever marketing and waning confidence in Western medicine. A third of the demand comes from EU countries, turning TCM into an Pounds 18 billion industry last year. British tourists visiting China are increasingly combining a visit to the Great Wall with a consultation at a TCM hospital, where they are offered lotus seed for kidney diseases, bupleurum root against liver tension, chrysanthemum to fight sinus problems, and seaweed to dissolve lumps. ""Of course, we fulfil every reasonable request of our patients,"" Dr Kong, head of the VIP ward, said. ""Our personalised service includes food prepared to order in the canteen."" For the doctors, the real purpose of these sessions is the opportunity to attract well-heeled private patients. The fee for a separate consultation and treatment plan can boost their miserly salaries. Few places better illustrate the shift from collectivism to commercialism in China than Dr Kong's hospital. In 1956, Chairman Mao gathered his best doctors at a cluster of courtyards once inhabited by a member of the imperial household. Their mission was to create a national health service with a network of state-run clinics. The first one was set up in the courtyard cluster and became the Beijing Traditional Medicine Hospital. Mao encouraged the use of TCM because herbal remedies were cheaper and only state leaders such as him were afforded Western drugs. Today, China accounts for only 10 per cent of the TCM market worldwide, but interest in traditional treatments is on the increase. Last year, domestic herbal remedy sales grew 22 per cent. Many Chinese who have switched back to herbal remedies did so because they could no longer afford Western treatments. Hu Bai, a cancer patient in Beijing, said: ""I used to take Western medicine because it works much better than TCM, but it's too expensive. If I get any pills at all now, they are herbal. "" The ancient cluster of courtyards in Beijing has been displaced by tiled high rise blocks with 550 hospital beds. Thanks to the fully-booked VIP wing, where beds cost up to Pounds 40 a night, Mao's model hospital is making a tidy profit."
26,1027.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Regulate quack medicine? I feel sick...," * If alternative remedies are either untested or ineffective, why are we promoting them?    It is fashionable to think things are true for no better reason than you wish it were so. Anything goes, from fairies, crystals and Ayurvedic medicine (as advocated by Cherie Blair) to fooling yourself about WMD (as advocated by her husband).    The latest sign of this trend is a report to the Department of Health from Professor Michael Pittilo, Vice-Chancellor of the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. His May report - on acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and the like - recommends that these therapies should have statutory regulation run by the Health Professions Council, and that entry for practitioners should ""normally be through a bachelor degree with honours"". Consultation is supposed to begin around now.     Both of the ideas in the report are disastrous. The first thing you wanted to know about any sort of medical treatment is: ""Does it work?"" One of the criteria that must be met by groups aspiring to regulation by the HPC is that they ""practise based on evidence of efficacy"". That evidence does not exist for herbal and Chinese medicine, which remain largely untested. For acupuncture the evidence does exist and it shows very clearly that acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo.    Placebos can, it is true, make you feel better; and if there is no better treatment, why not use them? That's fine, but it raises huge ethical questions about how much you can lie to patients, and how much you can lie to students who are training to use the placebos.    New Labour has often said that its policies are guided by the best scientific evidence, but the problem is that the answer you get depends on whom you ask. Pittilo's committee consisted of five acupuncturists, five herbalists and five representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (plus eleven observers). There was not a single scientist or statistician to help in the assessment of evidence. And it shows: the assessment of the evidence in the report was execrable.    Take one example, the use of a herbal preparation, Gingko biloba, for the treatment of dementia. On page 25 of the report we read: ""There have been numerous in vitro and in vivo trials on herbal medicine... which have established the benefits of single ingredients such as gingko...for vascular dementia"". That is totally out of date. The most prestigious source of reliable summaries of evidence, the Cochrane Collaboration, says: ""There is no convincing evidence that Ginkgo biloba is efficacious for dementia and cognitive impairment"". The NHS Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (compiled by alternative medicine people) says: ""The evidence that ginkgo has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unconvincing."" Since then another large trial, funded by the Alzheimer's Society, concludes: ""We found no evidence that a standard dose of high purity Ginkgo biloba confers benefit in mild-moderate dementia over six months.""    The Government's answer to the problem is, as always, to set up more expensive quangos to regulate alternative medicine. That might work if the regulation was effective, but experience has shown it isn't. It makes no sense to regulate placebos, especially if you don't admit that is what they are. The Government should be warned by the case of chiropractors about the dangers of granting official recognition before the evidence is available. The General Chiropractic Council already has a status similar to that of the General Medical Council, despite it being based on the quasi-religious idea of ""subluxations"" that nobody can see or define. Recent research has shown it to be no more effective, and less safe, than conventional treatments that are much cheaper.    The problems that Professor Pittilo's recommendations pose for universities are even worse. You cannot have universities teaching, as science, early 19th century vitalism, and how sticking needles into (imaginary) meridians rebalances the Qi so the body systems work harmoniously. To advocate that degrades the whole of science.    The vice-chancellors of the 16 or so universities who run such courses presumably do not themselves believe that vitalism is science, or subscribe to the view that ""amethysts emit high yin energy"", so it is hard to see why they accept taxpayers' money to teach such things. Thankfully, the University of Central Lancashire abandoned its first-year homoeopathy course this week because of low numbers.    Fortunately there is a much simpler, and probably much cheaper, solution than Pittilo's: enforce the laws that already exist. It is already illegal to sell contaminated and poisonous goods to the public. It is already illegal to sell goods that are not as described on the label. And, since May 2008, new European laws make it explicitly illegal to make claims for any sort of treatment when there is no reason to believe the claims are true. At the moment these laws are regularly and openly flouted on every hand. Enforce them and the problem is solved.    David Colquhoun is Research Professor of Pharmacology at University College London.

27,1028.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Health: Feel the force; An acupuncture alternative may fast be replacing many complementary therapies.  More and more people are turning to Chi Kung, reports Bill Harpe"," Acupuncture is increasingly respected in Europe as a complementary therapy. But acupuncture has its own complementary therapy. While in acupuncture the patient is passive and the practitioner does the work with needles, there is a therapy where the patient does all the work and the practitioner may not even be present.  This complementary therapy is called Chi Kung (also spelt Qigong and literally meaning 'cultivating energy'). Like acupuncture, Chi Kung utilises the meridians which are the basis of traditional Chinese medicine. Meridians are the pathways through the body, along which energy or chi flows. In the Chinese view, blockages of energy lie at the root of illness. Whereas in acupuncture a needle may be inserted into a meridian running to stimulate energy; in Chi Kung a heel-and-toe walking exercise can be used to produce the same kind of stimulation.  Given its provenance (like acupuncture Chi Kung has been tried, tested, and developed over at least two-and-a-half-thousand years) Chi Kung may indeed be the ultimate DIY therapy. And, while it has always been a mainstay of both preventative and curative medicine in China, this may now be a therapy whose time has come in the West. Interest has grown in the US over recent years and, with the recent publication of an authoritative and practical guide - The Chi Kung Way - Alive With Energy - Britain is beginning to wake up to the therapy. There are now teachers in London, Newcastle, Bristol, Reading, Liverpool, and Manchester. And this awakening to Chi Kung is due to be further stimulated by the publication in May of Basic T'ai Chi Chi Kung: 15 Ways To Find A Happier You. The author, James MacRitchie, is at Liverpudlian working in the US. After a training in dance and acupuncture, he became attracted to Chi Kung, because of its basis in using movement to stimulate energy.  MacRitchie now runs Boulder's Body-Energy Centre with his wife Damaris Jarboux, and is founding president of the Chi Kung/Qigong Association of America and a council member of the World Academic Society of Qigong (Beijing). In many ways that combination illustrates the ways in Chi Kung can be and is used. As Professor Feng, Director of the Immunology Research Centre in Beijing, notes in her foreword to the book, in both China and the West clinical research is being conducted into the curative capacities of Chi Kung, particularly in combating tumours and diseases such as diabetes. However, while Chi Kung is an essential part of Chinese medicine, and is being used in the West for its curative powers, it shares with other Chinese therapies the principle of trying to maintain health. Like the currently better known t'ai chi (the roots of which lie in the martial arts), Chi Kung exercises can be used to keep fit. It emphasises slow and gentle movements, which are said to help the flow of energy around the body, producing a feeling of well being and emotional stability. MacRitchie's book describes exercises for the gymnasium, field or bed - they may be performed at any age. But Chi Kung, like ballroom dancing, is not something which can be learnt entirely from a book - anyone interested should seek a personal teacher. The Chi Kung Way - Alive With Energy (A9.99), by James MacRitchie, is published by Thorsons.

28,1029.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,G2: Health: The sceptic: Acupuncture,"  The slogan for my wristband? ""Make bullshit history"". And I welcome to the struggle a group of Germans carrying sharp needles and giving out misleading instructions. A Munich-based complementary-medicine research centre recruited people complaining of frequent headaches. Three treatments were offered, two of them acupuncture. One type of acupuncture followed traditional Chinese principles. ""The other type,"" sufferers were told, did ""not follow the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, but (it) has also been associated with positive outcomes in clinical studies.""  The headaches must have been too blinding for them to have recognised such a great description of a placebo. Several hundred entered the trial. Those who were needled in the Chinese manner - by highly trained veteran acupuncturists, all aiming to achieve an irradiating feeling of ""de qi"" - experienced great benefit. The number of days spoilt by pounding headaches dropped away considerably. Those who underwent a treatment of sham acupuncture were looked after by the same practitioners. With equal skill and familiarity they shoved needles in flesh as far from recognised acupuncture points as possible. Any feeling of reaching ""de qi"" was vigorously avoided. The benefits were the same. Both placebos and acupuncture are sanctified by a long history of use. Could the researchers come up with something equally traditional for the third arm of the trial? They could, but they had to draw their inspiration from Britain rather than China: they put the remaining patients on a waiting list and did nothing. It didn't work. People don't like queues and they don't like needles, but it seems they're willing to accept the second as a good placebo. If it hurts, after all, it must be doing some good. All the patients in this trial suffered from tension headaches. It might be the case that a feeling of ""de qi"" is just the thing to get rid of a different headache such as a migraine (although that prospect has to seem less likely than it did before). Nevertheless, it's nice to see this recent study (British Medical Journal, August 13) giving us a rare fragment of reliable evidence with which to judge acupuncture. If only the authors had managed to avoid those deliberately misleading words ""complementary"" and ""alternative"". Let's be willing to properly test any treatment that might possibly work. If it does, let's name it a medicine. If it doesn't, we'll call it fraud. Bring on those wristbands."
29,1030.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Health: Chinese revolution: Liz Gill on how traditional medicine can relieve anything from arthritis to tachycardia,"  As a 65-year-old retired engineer, Peter Worsop is perhaps not the most likely candidate to be practising T'ai Chi in a glass-fronted shop in Manchester's Trafford Centre, visible to the curious eyes of passers-by. He used to be embarrassed, he says, but not any more, so grateful is he to the ancient form of exercise which, together with acupuncture and herbs, has relieved his arthritis and reduced his bouts of tachycardia. Worsop, however, could be seen as a symbol of the way in which traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, is increasingly moving from ethnic communities into the wider population. Indeed the premises in Manchester are themselves symbolic of the transition from backstreet mystery to mainstream commodity. The idea that you can now pick up a remedy based on the 3,000-year-old principles of yin and yang between nipping into Next and M&S is the brainchild of Dr John Wu, who opened his first Dr and Herbs shop in Luton in 1997 and now has 65 branches across the country, all based in shopping malls. Last year, he says, they dealt with a million consultations; this year he expects double that.  Dr Wu, 48, is himself an interesting example of cross-culturalism. Like many of his generation starting working life in China, under the cultural revolution he was only allowed to study TCM - the regime's fanatical anti-intellectualism forbade western medicine. When the revolution ended he switched to ophthalmology and became a specialist in cataract surgery. He did not, however, abandon TCM and would prescribe it for non-surgical conditions such as retinal haemorrhage in diabetics and corneal infections. Although a move to this country to work first at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and later at Southampton University as an epidemiologist setting up a glaucoma screening programme, prevented him continuing to mix the disciplines - British regulations do not allow such combinations - he never lost his conviction that the two could work in tandem. ""You don't have to pull down the old bridge over a river when you build a new one."" The problem, he believed, was one of image rather than efficacy: practioners were often hard to find, premises were shabby, clients had no sense of quality control or safety. What he decided to offer was walk-in accessibility and a recognised brand in which people could have confidence. In simple terms the theory behind TCM is that illness is caused by an imbalance in the body between the complimentary yet endlessly changing and interactive energies of yin and yang, or a blockage along one of the meridians or pathways associated with various organs through which flows the vital energy of Qi (pronounced 'chee'). A diagnosis is reached by taking a patient's history, looking at their tongue and taking their pulse: not just in the brief way of conventional medicine but more, as Dr Wu describes it, in the manner of playing a musical instrument. ""So you get a different interpretation according how much pressure each finger applies."" Problems can then be corrected by acupuncture, acupressure and herbal remedies to restore the proper energy balance and stimulate the appropriate meridians. Advocates claim it works for a vast number of conditions including migraines, skin diseases, hormonal problems, sexual dysfunction and infertility, stress and depression. In fact, they claim, virtually the only conditions it cannot treat are acute, life-threatening ones or something requiring surgery. Peter Worsop from Swinton, near Manchester, was one such. Married with a grown-up son and two grandchildren, he first developed arthritis in his right hand about 10 years ago. ""It was quite painful and it had also started to get worse. The joints were beginning to swell and it was also starting in my left hand. I tried anti-inflammatories but I didn't like the idea of having to take something for the rest of my life. ""My other problem was that I got this tachycardia. If I was stressed, particularly in situations over which I had no control, my heart beat could shoot up to 130 beats a minute. As well as being an awful sensation, it impairs the blood flow and so you can pass out. I hit the floor a few times. I had a full check-up but there was no underlying physical cause so I was sent to a behavioural psychologist who taught me relaxation techniques. They did work but you have to wait for the condition to come on and then practising meditation might not be very convenient if you're, say, in the middle of a traffic jam. ""I can't say I trooped around endless consultants, but I did feel that no one in western medicine could really help. They could give you things to make the conditions less unpleasant but they couldn't cure you, so when I saw the shop I thought I'd see what they could do."" After taking his history, checking his blood pressure, examining his tongue and taking his pulse for several minutes on both wrists, the doctor said his problems were renal in origin. The treatment was to comprise six weekly acupuncture sessions and a course of herbal medicine. She also recommended T'ai Chi as a means of relaxation. ""Every customer is given free instruction; you do it in the shop and everyone joins in, including the consultant."" The herbs were to be boiled for 30 minutes in two cupfuls of water every morning and the brew drunk. The same herbs were to be infused again in the evening and that weaker solution also drunk. ""The smell was disgusting and the taste was absolutely foul. ""But at the end of six weeks the arthritis had gone. The pain has stopped and the swelling seems to be going down. It's wonderful."" There are probably thousands of success stories like Peter Worsop's and presumably plenty of failures too. At the moment, however, all evidence remains anecdotal and the although many individual doctors maybe increasingly sympathetic to complimentary therapies the medical establishment in this country remains wary. A spokesperson for the British Medical Association says: ""We have no specific policy on TCM, but our view of alternative medicine generally is that it should all be more closely regulated by a statutory body, not just an organisation which practioners have set up themselves, but a regulated organisation with rules, recognised training and qualifications and which can also strike someone off. ""We're aware that lots of patients want to try these approaches but they should talk to their GP first if they're on conventional medication to see if there are any contradications.""

She has now brought her expertise home to Gorseinon Road, Penllergaer, and has just set up a business.Ruth says while the western world doesn't revere these therapies as much as the Chinese do, people in Britain are warming to them, with sport-addicted nations like the  Welsh relying on them more and more to keep joints and muscles moving.She says: ""While I was training in  Beijing  I spent some time in a teaching hospital.""There was all the usual equipment like the X-ray and the MRI machines but there was a huge section set aside for Chinese treatments, which are used alongside surgical and medical treatments over there.""I think people in this country are becoming more receptive. Lots of rugby players have sports massages and physio and complementary therapies like Shiatzu are popular.""Ruth demonstrates some of the basic manipulation techniques used in Tuina, the method of Chinese massage she uses.Before treating a new client, Ruth takes them through a detailed assessment of their  medical history and of any existing medical conditions, investigating sleep patterns and lifestyle points.The subject lies on their stomach, fully clothed, while Ruth works the body using a series of hand movements, which include thumb pressing, hacking (striking quickly and lightly with the side of the hand) shearing (running the sides of he hands quickly over an area, percussion, squeezing and cupping (striking with cupped hands).Like reflexology, the regime works on the theory that different points of the body correspond to internal organs and that physical complaints can arise when energy  is hampered in its movement around the body. So a Thinah, or body map, charting the joints, muscles, blood circulation and lymph flow is used as a guide.It is a reasonably  rigorous experience with physical knots being untied and problem areas being given short shrift.And the treatment is undoubtedly a stress-buster, carried out in relaxed and informal surroundings.For more details abut the Zen Acupuncture and Massage Centre call 01792 891546."

Based on natural remedies, incorporating herbs and acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a holistic approach to medicine, which aims to restore a person's health, balance and harmony on all levels - physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Dr David Xiu, who opened the medical centre in May last year, was born and raised near the coastal city of Shandong, in eastern China. His interest in medicine started in childhood when he accompanied his mother, who suffered from a chronic heart condition, on visits to her traditional doctor.When the universities re-opened after the Cultural Revolution, Dr Xiu followed through his interest and began his eight years of medical training. Like all Chinese medical students, he learned western and traditional methods in parallel.They are very different, but highly complementary systems, he explains.""Many of my patients have tried conventional medicine first, but have found it has not worked for them. They do not get results and so they come to my clinics,"" Dr Xiu says.""Chinese medicine can't cure serious conditions such as cancer, but it can help with some of the symptoms. And for lots of other chronic conditions it can have the most effective results and even offer complete cures.""Chinese medicine has a very impressive pedigree - Taoist monks established the circulation of the blood, not described in the west until the 17th century, in 200BC and Chinese doctors pioneered smallpox inoculations more than 1,000 years ago.And certainly, Dr Xiu has gathered a wide variety of testimonials from patients grateful for the treatment he has prescribed.Young mum Rachel Cole, 24, had suffered from painful and disfiguring eczema all her life before turning to Dr Xiu in desperation.Rachel, who lives near Wakefield, says: ""I have used all the cream, from the mildest to the strongest, and in the end seem to have become immune to their effects. It was my last hope when I went to Dr Xiu. My dad suggested it and offered to pay. I was a little doubtful, but thought 'let's give it a chance'. And it worked brilliantly.""The eczema on my hands was so bad, I couldn't even hold a pen.""Dr Xiu gave me some herbal tea to make up each day. I don't know what's in it, but it works - even though it tastes disgusting.""I can bend my fingers again and my mum reckons my whole attitude has changed.

B is for Bach Flower Remedies Developed in the 1930s by Dr Edward Bach, there are 38 of these flower essence remedies, which can help to alleviate negative emotions. C is for Calcium A vital nutrient that helps to maintain bones and teeth, as well as performing a variety of other very important functions, calcium is found in a wide range of foods, such as cheese, yoghurt, eggs and spinach. D is for Dandelion More often associated with the fizzy drink Dandelion and Burdock, this humble flower has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to stimulate the liver and to clear toxins from the blood, among other applications. E is for Evening Primrose Evening Primrose was traditionally used as a remedy for coughs brought on by colds, but is now used to treat a variety of other conditions, too, including depression. It can also be made into an ointment for skin rashes.  F is for Fitness Getting fit doesn't mean being confined to a sweaty gym or paying homage to stretch latex in an aerobics studio. Choose an activity that you actually enjoy and you're more likely to stick with it. So if you like cycling to work or walking your dog - this all counts as regular exercise!  G is for Garlic Eating a clove of raw garlic every day can boost your immune system. If you cannot face that, then take a garlic supplement. H is for Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is the most ancient form of medicine in the world. In herbal medicine, plants - or parts of plants - are used to treat illness, relieve common ailments and restore health. The stems, leaves, flowers, roots, bark, berries and seeds of plants can be used. They are either dried for use in teas or made into ointments, powders, pills, capsules, lozenges or tinctures. I is for insomnia Most people get insomnia at some stage. Fortunately it is usually a short-term problem. To help, try avoiding caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol late in the day. Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants and can keep you from falling asleep. Alcohol can cause waking in the night and interferes with sleep quality. Get regular exercise, try not to exercise close to bedtime because it may stimulate you and make it hard to fall asleep. J is for Juicing Particularly popular in the USA, where the 'smoothie' is a major hit, juicing basically involves extracting and drinking the juice of fresh, raw fruits and vegetables. It's seen as a great way to get vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates into the body fast. However, it's not suitable for everyone. K is for Kelp Kelp is seaweed which has a positive effect on the thyroid gland due to its high iodine content. Kelp also has been shown to bind to heavy metals, environmental toxins and fats, decreasing their absorption from the digestive tract. This may, in part, be the reason why certain degenerative diseases and cancers have a lower incidence in areas of high seaweed diets. L is for Letting Go In today's busy world, finding the time to relax can be tough, but we all need to unwind. Take yourself off to a quiet room, unplug the phone, dim the lights, lay back in a comfortable chair and just let go. Before long you'll be fighting fit once more. M is for Minerals Minerals are vital to you. In 1914 an-apple-a-day gave half the daily requirement for iron. But because the mineral content of apples is now much less you would need to eat 26 of today's apples to obtain the same amount of iron as your grandparents got from one. N is for Nicotine Replacement Therapy If you're a smoker, you'll know the best thing you can do for your health is give up the demon weed. It can be a real struggle, but it can be done. And there's plenty of help available through products such as nicotine gum and patches. Talk to your pharmacist and wave tobacco goodbye for good. O is for Organic Organic means food has been produced without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and animals have been reared without the routine use of antibiotics and other drugs. P is for Protein A complex organic compound, protein builds and maintains body tissues, helps to create enzymes, hormones and antibodies and assists with transportation of fats, vitamins and minerals. Found in foods such as meat, poultry, fish, cereals, nuts, seeds and pulses. Q for Qigong Usually pronounced 'chi kung', this Chinese exercise system involves slow, rhythmical exercises, plus special breathing, meditation and visualisation techniques. Qigong is widely accepted as a way to help reduce stress. R is for Reflexology Reflexology is more than just foot massage. It can aid relaxation and stimulate the circulatory system. Reflexology is a science following the principle that energy travels through the body along pathways known as meridians or zones. S is for St John's Wort Use of this yellow herb dates back to ancient Greece, when it was believed its aroma had magical powers and it was a treatment for many ailments. It is used to help combat conditions such anxiety and depression. T is for Tai Chi The benefits of Tai Chi are immense and include improved co-ordination, circulation, posture, balance and well-being. The stress relieving attributes are one of the main reasons why people start Tai Chi. U is for U-turn It is never too late to make a U-turn in your lifestyle.

Your U-turn could change your life into a better direction. V is for Vitamins Vitamins are necessary for our growth, vitality, and general well-being. With the exception of vitamin D, the human body cannot make its own vitamins, and some cannot be stored. Vitamins must therefore be obtained from a food on a daily basis. A person's diet must provide all the necessary vitamins. W is for Water Making up more than two thirds of our body, water really is the staff of life. Drinking enough can help to alleviate problems as diverse as asthma, migraines and lower back pain. Taking six to eight glasses daily is recommended, though drinks like alcohol, coffee and tea don't count. X is for Kissing!  XXX is often written on a greetings card or a letter. And kissing is good for you because... It relieves tension - a passionate kiss is a great relaxation technique - and it certainly boosts self-esteem.

Acupuncture, a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting tiny, painless needles into key points on the body, may be able to help. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in treating the hot flushes, anxiety and depression that so often accompany the menopause.  Acupuncturist Isobel Cosgrove is in no doubt about its efficacy. She said: ""The menopause is the end of your childbearing years, which is a big emotional shift, and it can be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as heavy bleeding, which can be very draining. ""In addition to that, people often suffer from hot flushes, joint pain, vaginal dryness, memory loss, night sweats and anxiety. ""I use acupuncture at all stages of life to balance hormonal activity. The reason acupuncture is so good at this is that it treats the major organs that govern ""You can put a needle into a certain energy channel (meridian) on the leg, and that energy channel flows up to the major organs - so it can look like we're treating the leg or the foot, but in fact we are treating the organs that distribute and regulate hormonal activity.

This treatment method is now available for you at Urban Roots  - The Calming Room on Mutley Plain, carried out by celebrity beauty therapist Mandy McCleave.Chinese cups are used in the prevention and treatment of disease of the body and can be applied for many ailments. This ancient wisdom is based upon the flow of qi in the body. Blockages of energy flow are alleviated by a vacuum cup being placed on the meridian line.Its history goes back to 300 BC when bamboo barrels were used for this purpose. However, it was in the Qing Dynasty that medical experts combined it with acupuncture and popularised it. In modern day China, the cupping method has been continuously improved and is used in most departments of internal medicine and gained popularity throughout the western world.The treatment consists of a cup being placed on the skin and a vacuum being created by smoke or by suction. Mandy said: ""I prefer to use the suction method as it can be adjusted to the client's comfort. The cup is left in place for approximately 10 minutes. It can be placed on acupuncture points but as I mainly use this therapy in my spa for sports injuries, I mostly use what is called the 'ashi point', or the point of pain. If a client has a back spasm or a pulled hamstring, the cups are placed directly on the painful muscle until the pain is relieved.""""I often combine it with needle-free acupuncture, which is the use of silicone chips to activate the cells surrounding the acupuncture point, which in turn can stimulate the internal organs to heal and balance."""

But now he swears by it.""I injured my right ankle landing badly while catching a rugby ball in the garden last Christmas, and it swelled up,"" said Dominic, 32, of Heavitree.""I went to a doctor, who said there wasn't much I could do apart from take anti-inflammatory tablets and painkillers.""But after a month the ankle was still the same size - massive -  and I knew it was too long for it to have been so swollen.""Then Dominic, the intellectual property rights manager at the Met Office, bumped into a colleague, Mireille Hartley, a qualified acupuncturist.""She said it might help,"" he said. ""It's the first time I've tried something like it and initially I was really nervous because I actually hate needles, but after one treatment I knew it worked - I also knew it didn't hurt.""Mireille treated me using needles and a laser, which seems to be very good for muscle. After five or six treatments, the swelling went down and now my ankle is fine.""In fact, Dominic was so impressed with the results, he now turns to Mireille before trying anything else.""I used to be a fishmonger and developed repetitive strain injury in my back from bending down all the time,"" he said. ""It has always been there, but because the treatment had worked on my ankle I thought it would work for my back.""Now I've got no backache and my ankle has healed up. It's definitely solved the problems, and I've been telling all my friends to go for acupuncture and laser therapy.""Mireille qualified at the South West College of Oriental Medicine in Bristol five years ago and spent five weeks in China in 2004, working at hospitals in Hangzhou city where acupuncture is used as a routine treatment.""Acupuncture's capabilities surprise a lot of people. You can treat almost anything,"" she said.""Some people come to me and list all the pills they are on, but there is another way. Painkillers often just mask the pain rather than sort out the problem.""The World Health Organisation has produced a  list of disease categories which traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, can benefit, including asthma, sinusitis, migraine, high blood pressure, arthritis, strains, and sprains.To help those who aren't keen on needles, Mireille also offers low-level light therapy using laser treatment. ""I realise that a lot of people are needle-phobic,"" Mireille said.""Low-level light is quite simply a beam that stimulates cell growth, bone knitting and muscle knitting, and it's very effective - it's like acupuncture but without needles.  I went to the States to learn about it last November.""Mireille now works part-time at the Met Office and spends two days a week practising acupuncture and laser therapy at Orange Blossom spa in Exeter. She can also visit clients in their homes.She said: ""When Dominic told me about the problems he was having, I knew I could help - and what a turnaround.""Dr Graham Archard, vice-chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""Evidence has shown that acupuncture is very effective for the treatment of acute pain, but it does not seem to be quite so effective in the treatment of long-term pain.  It's very much a treatment rather than a cure.""Mireille can be contacted on on 01392 422355 or 07970 418936.How acupuncture worksAcupuncture is a therapeutic practice believed to have begun in China in 200BC and involves needles being inserted into defined points on the body.The technique forms an important part of traditional medicine practices in China, Japan and Korea and spread across most parts of Asia.Practitioners claim that acupuncture works by normalising the flow of ""qi"" - vital energy - in the body. Theory suggests it is able to help illness by manipulating blockages of ""qi"".  Devotees subscribe to the maxim ""no blockage, no pain"".  A sensation of stimulus known as ""deqi"" is the effect of the treatment working."
36,1037.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,The highest point in acupuncture art,"  A Nottingham acupuncturist Andrew Kemp has had his expertise recognised - by the masters of traditional Chinese medicine. LYNETTE PINCHESS reports Andrew Kemp, a former social worker and trainee probation officer, became fascinated after a friend with alopecia - serious hair loss - had acupuncture with startling results. After training, he went for a career swap, and has now been practising for 21 years.  Now his expertise in acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine and massage has earned him a rare accolade. He has been awarded an honorary doctorate from a major teaching hospital in China's Zhejiang province. Mr Kemp is a senior lecturer in Chinese herbal medicine at the London College of Oriental Medicine and practitioner at the recently opened Grange Complementary Health Clinic in Mansfield Road. He visits China regularly for research and to increase his specialist knowledge. He had taken a party of postgraduate students to Hangzhou Hospital to study Chinese medicine when he was presented with the accolade. He said: ""It came as a complete surprise. It is a recognition of my skills in Chinese medicine. It is the only one the hospital has given out to a Westerner. It was a very nice gesture. I don't know of anyone else in the UK who has received such an award from a Chinese hospital."" The Hangzhou is about the same size as Nottingham City Hospital. Mr Kemp said: ""In many it is similar to a Western hospital. The only difference is that you turn a corner and suddenly come across a load of patients receiving acupuncture. In China the two traditions sit side by side comfortably."" The treatment was developed around 4,000 years ago and is based on the theory that energy, or qi, flows through pathways in the body. When qi's equal and opposite qualities - yin and yang - become unbalanced, illness may result. By inserting fine needles into the channels of energy an acupuncturist can stimulate the body's own healing response and help restore its natural balance. This is the method used by Mr Kemp. A Western version has developed over the past 30 years. It is similar to the Chinese but is based on the principles of modern conventional medicine and is usually practised by healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. Acupuncture is used to treat diverse problems including pain, nausea, menstrual/menopause problems, bladder, bowel or digestive ailments, skin problems, infertility and allergies. It is being increasingly used by patients trying to overcome drink, drugs and smoking addictions. Mr Kemp, a member of British Acupuncture and of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, has teamed up with homeopath Britt Rubin, a former registered nurse, to open Grange Complementary Health Clinic. The clinic works in partnership with NHS doctors, who can refer patients, and only employs fully qualified practitioners with a minimum of five years' practical experience."

It is a complete medical system capable of treating a wide range of conditions including herbal therapy, acupuncture, dietary therapy, and exercises in breathing and movement. The medicine is based on the concepts of Yin and Yang aiming to treat the ways balance and harmony between the two may be undermined. What are the herbs like and how much will they cost?Herbs are available in traditional and modern formats. The traditional method is to boil a mixture of dried herbs to make a tea or to use pills. The herbs are also now commonly prescribed as freeze dried powders or tinctures. Prices are dependant on individual practitioners.How popular is traditional Chinese medicine in the UK?Favoured by high profile public figures from Prince Charles to Cherie Blair (pictured), an estimated one million British adults receive herbal prescriptions each year. Reports of the benefits in treating childhood eczema created interest  during the early 1990s. Use has now spread beyond the ethnic Chinese population to all population groups.The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine (RCHM), the self-regulating body which represents practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine, has seen its membership grow by on average 30 per cent per annum to 400 members in the UK at present."

""If you visit your GP you explain your symptoms and the GP will carry out an examination which may result in tests,"" explains clinical director Sean Barkes.""This culminates in a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.""In Chinese medicine, the process is principally the same and, because our approach is an holistic one, we spend upwards of an hour attending to the individual circumstances of the patient.""We then treat the condition appropriately by using acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese massage, specialised forms of exercise known as Chi Kung and T'ai Chi or a combination of all of these and other therapies.""For example, a patient may come to us with a frozen shoulder. We delve into the underlying reasons for why the shoulder is sore, as well as physically examining the joint itself.""For instance, the patient may have suffered a trauma or have been going through a traumatic time emotionally which may have caused prolonged tightness in the shoulders and neck.""We treat each patient individually according to the findings of our examination and observations. Ten cases of frozen shoulder may require 10 different approaches.""At the Clinic of Traditional Chinese Medicine the therapists treat a variety of conditions including infertility, women's problems, pregnancy-related problems, migraine and headaches, muscular pain, arthritis, sciatica, IBS, anxiety and depression, post-operative pain, asthma, insomnia and many more.The clinic employs five therapists, all of whom have completed degree level training and are members of the British Acupuncture Council.All five therapists work closely together to share their knowledge and expertise.""We are a large practice.

40,1041.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Nothing to fear from healing needles,"One of the most popular and well-established forms of complementary medicine in the UK, acupuncture is a branch of traditional Chinese medicine where any illness - physical or psychological - is thought to arise from an imbalance in your vital energy, or Qi (pronounced (chee). Inserting fine needles at key areas on the body is said to restore the balance.One of the aspects I like about complementary therapists is that they begin any treatment with a full and detailed consultation. Acupuncturist Katy Henry asked me about my physical health and state of mind. It has been  a tumultuous few months because of a family bereavement. Add the daily stresses of juggling family life and work, Christmas preparations and those dreary winter days into the equation, I'm hardly  on top form.We run through my diet, how much fluid I consume, my sleeping habits,  family life, how I see myself and how my friends would describe me.The next question made me blush....""Do you still have good sex?"" asked Katy.Well, I'll leave that between the two of us....but Katy explains that 50% of  her clients have fertility problems.She said: ""You'd be amazed at the number of people trying for a baby who don't have regular enough sex.""Katy, who has been practising for five years, specialises in fertility problems and some of her clients have had recurrent miscarriages or are going through IVF.Other clients include workmen like joiners and welders, who are suffering pain in their shoulders, back and elbows.While acupuncture won't necessarily solve the problem, it can relieve the symptoms.Katy, a member of the British Acupuncture Council, uses a branch known as five element acupuncture which works on several levels: the body, mind and spirit.She said: ""The beautiful thing about acupuncture is we don't see you as a bunch of conditions or symptoms but a whole person and bringing balance to you.""In winter we are using our reserves of energy to keep going and perhaps that is why sometimes people feel down.""After the lengthy consultation, it is time for me to hop on the couch.When she shows me the needles that are to go in my ears, they are so fine I can barely see them.There was a slight sting as the needle was inserted on the right but I didn't feel a thing on the left.Katy also uses moxa, a dried spongy herb, which is rolled into tiny cones and burnt down on my abdomen to get the blood and Qi flowing smoothly. It was warm, aromatic and relaxing.Finally, needles are inserted straight in and out of both sides of my wrists.Clients are normally treated each week for a month and they'll know within that time if the treatment is having an  effect. I only had a short taster session so I don't know if it would make me feel better after more treatments but I can honestly say, if you're afraid of needles, it doesn't hurt.To find a therapist in your area contact the British Acupuncture Council on 0208 735 0400.Or contact Katy, who works from Head 2 Toe in West Bridgford and Complexions in Arnold, on 07759 549791.An initial consultation and treatment lasting one and a half hours costs �50.

That's what medical qiqong is,"" said Anita, ""a technique to free up the dam, or it can be a technique to speed up the waterfall if it is the source point that needs the attention.""Acupuncture is perhaps the best known of the traditional Chinese medicines, and like gigong works on freeing up blocked channels or meridians in the body.  Karen Glancey has treated more than 200 patients since opening Anroach Clinic in 2004 - a third of those with skeletal pain such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and sciatica, plus she treats patients with conditions such as migraine, ME, MS, cystitis, depression and fertility and gynaecological problems, to name a few - though there are some who visit her as part of a general healthy living regime. Needles can be inserted either into ashi points - tender points local to the area to be treated - or distal points, which are further away.  Either way, the intention is that the needles stimulate the body's own responses and, like qigong, restore its balance.  Generally, patients will attend for six to ten sessions of treatment, with some improvement expected to be seen after three.""It is a concern that a lot of people are afraid of needles though nine out of ten people say that once they've been they wouldn't be afraid to come again.  Patients may experience numbness or tingling, but generally speaking, people are very relaxed once they have the needles in and they've been in for a while,"" said Karen.Perhaps unsurprisingly, clinical hypnotherapist, Hilary Pickford said: ""A lot of people come along expecting me to say 'look into my eyes...' But it's really about very deep relaxation.""Often people attend Hilary's clinics to get rid of habits such as smoking or teeth grinding, though hypnotherapy can have a positive effect on mental illnesses - depending upon how long they have had the illness and how it is being treated.  Others simply enjoy the feeling of deep relaxation that it brings.""It's like the feeling of falling asleep or just waking up - you're aware of what's going on, but you can't be bothered to do anything about it,"" said Hilary.Throughout the session Hilary must monitor the client's breathing and talk to them, she also teaches them self-hypnosis and other techniques that can help to calm them once they realise they are becoming stressed.""Everybody experiences hypnotherapy differently, but I've never had anybody say they didn't like it,"" she said.Lois Cole trained in holistic and therapeutic therapy 13 years ago.  This kind of therapy works in one of two ways - either to bring psychological benefits or physical ones.  So clients range from those suffering from depression or grief, for example, to physical conditions like sports injuries or internal problems like constipation.Unlike aromatherapy massage where much of the work is done by the oil that is used, therapeutic massage is reliant upon the strokes, touch and physical manipulation.While Lois would not work on cancer patients, as the massage could risk spreading the disease, therapeutic massage is very good for the circulation and any related problems, as it flushes out toxins and helps the blood to flow more freely.""Therapeutic massage can be quite painful - but it depends on the person's pain threshold - some therapies work by going in really deep but the person has to work with you - if they are bracing against you then there's no point.""But when I'm giving a deep massage, afterwards the muscles just sort of give up holding out and then the nutrients flow through and you can see the benefit to the muscles,"" said Lois."

Since then, the business has extended to 16 branches, employing its own highly-qualified team of researchers, doctors and acupuncture practitioners.  Mr Ren, who learned about medicine at the Da Lian Maritimel University in China, plans to open between 20 and 30 new branches, including Scunthorpe, in the UK within the next year. His aim is to achieve a target 50 branches in this country and then expand the business into Europe. Like the outlet in Slough, the new Scunthorpe business will be operated from one of six kiosks built in the Parishes alongside the KwikSave supermarket. Supporters of traditional Chinese medicine point out it has been used for therapies for more than 3,000 years and is effective in curing most human diseases. The medicines are all natural and said to be more effective than western remedies on long-term illnesses. Mr Ren, however, stressed in the UK Chinese treatment was only used to complement orthodox treatments patients were receiving from their own GPs. He explained acupuncture was a form of treatment involving insertion of thin steel needles which stimulated vital energy points. Its aim was to regulate the channels of energy, re-establish the energy balance and to relieve pain. Other treatments on offer at Scunthorpe will include acupressure (a Chinese medical massage) and dry herbs to be taken as either tea or in tablet, powder or lotion form. Everwell, which operates its own online pharmacy, claims Chinese medicine will help in the treatment of many common illnesses like eczema, migraine, hay fever and asthma."

Treatments such as meditation and a holistic approach to maintaining health have entered the mainstream and are included in the arsenal for fighting a variety of conditions, from mental health problems to Alzheimer's.One sign of the growing acceptance of traditional Chinese medicine is the news in March that German pharmaceutical giant Bayer had agreed to buy privately-held Chinese traditional herbal medicine maker Dihon Pharmaceutical Group �[#x20ac]"" a deal rumoured to be worth over $500 million. Bayer said its goals were to strengthen its life-sciences portfolio, grow its business in China and gain a foothold in the traditional Chinese medicine market.This is a significant development, as international pharmas had been reluctant to invest in traditional medicine. Naturally there were good reasons for this, as there are marked differences in Eastern and Western medical systems.While Western medicine is empirical and focused on treating specific diseases, Eastern systems, including Thai traditional medicine, are more inclined to look at the body as a connected whole and they often use a range of treatments and herbal concoctions.This can make it difficult to measure the efficacy of any particular treatment.Another problem is regulation. While orthodox drug treatments have to pass rigorous testing before being approved for human application, in the past herbs used in traditional medicine were often classified as foods rather than medicines and so avoided such rigorous testing. This is changing and in 2011 the EU introduced the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive, prohibiting the sale of unlicensed herbal medicinal products, with a two-year grace period to conform.Despite such challenges, it is interesting to see some convergence in the two approaches. There is a trend in the West towards integrated medicine and life sciences that takes a much broader approach towards medicine than merely treating an isolated ailment. One example of this is the experimental use of bioinformatics, which attempts to employ advanced computer systems to gain an understanding of traditional Chinese medicine mechanisms.Meanwhile Western medicine is increasingly being used alongside traditional medicine in China. Many hospitals in Asia including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand offer traditional Chinese medicine, while the WHO has established collaborative centres for traditional medicine in the US, Asia, Europe and Africa.With the rapid ageing of populations around the world and the increasing interest in healthy lifestyles, let's hope these efforts to combine the best of the West and the East bear fruit so that more people can enjoy a healthy future."

She would have turned 26 on Oct 3.  Her death has ignited a debate over cancer treatment in China, according to the BBC and Chinese media reports. According to the Shanghaiist website and other reports, she revealed to her 300,000 fans on Weibo in July that she had been diagnosed with lymphoma. Even though she said that TCM might not cure her, it was still preferable to chemotherapy, reported The Nanfang. ""I know that chemotherapy is extremely painful and is a process that can even speed up my death,"" she wrote, adding that she did not want to ""let chemotherapy torment me to the point where there's no beauty and talent left"". In a post on July 24, she shared pictures of her back covered with cupping marks and her undergoing jiu sha, a folk remedy that involves repeated pinching, usually of the neck and back, to increase blood circulation. She said it was tough to endure the treatments. ""When it hurts, I'll joke with the nurses so that I can bear the pain."" However, said Sina website, the procedures did not seem to work and her younger sister eventually convinced her to switch her course of treatment and said: ""She was cheated by so many cheats that she's turned to chemotherapy only now."" Xu was the third of seven children. She made her debut on television in the series Dad Home (2013) and her movies include the comedy Lost In Macau (2015)."

The businesses advertise themselves as TCM clinics with signboards outside the premises promoting treatments like tui na, cupping and acupuncture. However, when approached, female employees at seven of the establishments The Sunday Times visited said a ""doctor"" was not available. Six of the businesses instead offered a different kind of massage, with options for ""happy"" and ""special"" endings, terms used to describe sexual services. The women dressed in short dresses pointed to their bodies when making the offer.  The six ""clinics"" were traced to the same owner with more than 30 establishments with the word ""TCM"" listed as part of their Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) registered names. The Sunday Times learnt that the registered owner of the clinics is a licensed TCM practitioner. GIVING OTHERS A BAD NAMEThere is a small group of black sheep who do this to make a quick buck. They tarnish the reputation of this respected profession. PHYSICIAN TAY KIM SOON, on illicit activities in TCM clinics operated by errant practitioners.       Some of the establishments are registered under the category of Clinics and other General Medical Services (Non-western) in their Acra profiles. To register a TCM business with Acra, companies need to first obtain the required approval from the relevant regulatory authorities, said an Acra spokesman. In the case of TCM, physicians have to be registered with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (TCMPB), a statutory board under the Ministry of Health (MOH). TCM clinics are not required to be registered with MOH. The registered TCM practitioner must then submit the English and Chinese name of the clinic to the board for approval first, before registering the company with Acra. It is unclear if this was done for the six TCM clinics The Sunday Times visited last month. Separately, the Acra spokesman said owners registering a business with names and activities containing the terms ""hospital"", ""medical clinic/centre""or any other similar terms are also required to get approval from MOH first. Registered physicians have to display their original registration certificate conspicuously at their main place of practice and a certified true-copy at all other places of practice, said TCMPB's executive secretary Quah Ai Mui. It is an offence for a person who is not registered as a TCM practitioner to practise, advertise or claim to be qualified to carry out prescribed TCM practice, she added. ""It is also an offence to employ someone who is not qualified or registered to practise any prescribed practice of TCM."" If convicted for practising TCM or advertising oneself as a qualified TCM practitioner, first-time offenders can be fined up to $25,000 and jailed for six months. For employing someone who is not a qualified TCM physician to carry out related practices, those convicted face a similar penalty. Spas and massage outlets - some of which have been fronts for those offering sexual services - have found it more difficult to receive a licence to operate from the Police Licensing and Regulatory Department. This has prompted a growth in ""TCM"" establishments in recent years, said those in the industry. TCM physicians The Sunday Times spoke to said they are aware of such illicit activities in TCM clinics operated by errant practitioners. Said physician Tay Kim Soon, who has been practising for over 15 years: ""There is a small group of black sheep who do this to make a quick buck. They tarnish the reputation of this respected profession."" Police often raid massage establishments to weed out those that operate illegally. Last June, 75 people were arrested in a four-day enforcement blitz on unlicensed massage parlours and public entertainment outlets. Last November, police also nabbed 81 women in raids at Thomson, Paya Lebar, Selegie, Outram and Bukit Timah areas. A police spokesman said: ""We take a tough stand against vice activities and will continue with our regular enforcement checks to deter and detect such illegal activities. ""Operators found conducting illicit activities in massage establishments will be taken to task."""

I have undergone both Western and Chinese treatments. I have heard of treatments like acupuncture, cupping, tui na and 'walking the wall'. What do you advise I do? Collagen plays an important part in ligaments and tendons because it holds the bones together in a joint.In the view held by Western doctors of diabetic patients, glucose molecules attach themselves to collagen, resulting in abnormal deposits of collagen in the cartilage and tendons of the shoulder.This build-up causes the affected shoulder to stiffen. It occurs most commonly in the shoulders, but can happen in other parts of the body as well.'Walking the wall' is an exercise where someone stands facing the wall and runs his fingers upwards on it. A patient with a frozen shoulder has difficulty lifting his hands in this manner. This exercise can help him loosen the cartilage and tendons of his shoulders.TCM practitioners believe a frozen shoulder is caused by external injury, a deficiency and stagnation in qi and blood, and pathogenic factors such as 'wind', 'cold' and 'dampness'.Chinese medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy and tui na can improve your condition by enhancing circulation of qi and blood and dispelling the pathogenic factors.You should keep your joints warm by avoiding a cold environment like an air-conditioned room, and by wearing extra clothing. You should also abstain from cold drinks. Stick to a strict diet and monitor your fasting blood glucose level to ensure it is within a healthy range.Information provided by Ms Lim Lay Beng, a TCM physician at YS Healthcare TCM Clinic in The Adelphi."
49,1050.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,A Cure For All?,"Kao ChenTRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINEEast is East and West is West but will the twain ever meet -- in medicine? Can traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), like acupuncture (above), ever blend with modern medicine? To put a finger on its pulse, senior correspondent KAO CHEN visited Beijing, Shanghai, Hongkong and Taipei and talked to 55 officials, doctors and researchers. In the first of a four-part series, she looks at TCM in the land of its birthIMAGINE a 500-bed modern hospital where patients are treated by herbal brews and injected with -- or given intravenous drips of -- traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).When they are wheeled into a theatre, they are operated with the aid of acupuncture.Shocked?Welcome to Beijing's Xiyuan and Guang An Men Hospitals, which rank among China's best health-care institutions and represent the striking new face of TCM. Judging by the 2,500 patients who crowd Guang An Men Hospital every day, TCM is alive and kicking in the country of its birth.After almost fading away in the first half of the last century, when much of China's traditional culture came under siege from influences of the West, TCM has staged a robust comeback.Thanks to an aggressive modernising programme under the communist government, TCM has become part of the country's formal tertiary education system since 1956.Active research has led to the rise of an array of new TCM drugs and treatment for cancer, heart disease, hepatitis and malaria -- some through the re-discovery of a lost or secret formula, others from new research.What's more, a dialogue between Western medicine and TCM has been initiated.It is true that the two theories -- one based on modern science, and the other on ying, yang and the five elements (metals, wood, water, fire, and earth) -- remain worlds apart.While Western medicine is concerned with the disease, TCM focuses on the state of health of the whole body, and often treats the same disease with different medications and prescribes the same medicine for different diseases, all because of the differences in the nature of the bodies.Still, it is now common in China to find doctors who are trained in both disciplines and able to integrate them in practice in varying degrees.Acupuncture is the field which has witnessed the most breakthroughs.Dramatic images of patients bristling with needles like a porcupine yet alert and showing no pain stunned Western media and the world in the 1970s following former US President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing.Acupuncture has now won a level of acceptance from the mainstream, orthodox medicine in the West that was unthinkable two decades ago.Will other TCM disciplines soon follow?To put a finger on the pulse, Sunday Review spoke to Dr Shen Zhixiang, secretary-general of China's State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM) in Beijing, which is a bureau under the Health Ministry.Expressing cautious optimism, he replies: ""We must address a few issues first, but I think TCM's time has finally come.""He cites favourable conditions in the West: A yearning for a more holistic approach to medicine, which has enhanced the appeal of TCM, known for its focus on the wellness of the whole person.In addition, there is a strong back-to-nature movement and rising demand for natural, herbal-based medicine and health products as an alternative to chemical-based medicine and adverse side effects.But Dr Shen acknowledges the stumbling blocks still in the way. ""We still have problems with quality control. There is a proliferation of both fake, sub-standard herbs as well as counterfeit proprietary formulations.""Another issue, he notes, is how to modernise TCM without turning it into a branch of Western medicine.To address the quality issue, he says, the Chinese government started phasing in a set of regulations in the late 1990s known as the five Ps -- good agricultural practice, good manufacturing practice, good laboratory practice, good clinical practice, and good selling practice.""We want to ensure that not even trace heavy metals, which are viewed as toxins in Western medicine, are in the formulations, that they are made under the same conditions as modern pharmaceutical industries elsewhere.""In addition, the authorities are tackling the issue of the quality of herbs, which will always vary, he notes.But with good agricultural practice, people will be assured of their authenticity (di dao yao cai), that they are not contaminated by fertilisers and pollutants, and grown in optimal climate and conditions.HOW MODERN SHOULD IT BE?THE debate over how far to push the modernisation of TCM is more controversial.One of those who favour modernisation is Professor Qiao Wangzhong, deputy party secretary at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, the leading TCM university in China.Speaking in his office, he argues that the ""T"" should be dropped from the term ""TCM"", because it implies a closed mind to progress and development.His views have wide support. Even some old-timers, like 81-year-old Dr Yan Zhenghua, the well-known TCM doctor in Beijing, says that ""the age of just using three fingers is over"", referring to the traditional method of feeling the pulse for diagnosis. ""TCM will die unless it moves with the times"".But detractors insist that too much modern training will dilute the TCM physician's special expertise.To SATCM's Dr Shen, however, these issues pale by comparison to what is keeping TCM back from joining the world: Its credibility as a science.""Some still consider it un proven -- that it is based on anecdotal instead of hard evidence, that it is not a solid science.""There is no escaping the yawning chasm that still separates TCM from modern Western medicine.TCM's proponents say that its 5,000 years of history represent the best clinical evidence that it works.But its critics maintain that TCM theory is not anatomically correct, and that its efficacy is based on anecdotal evidence, and that its reliability is an issue.Some argue that the qi (vital energy) and xue (blood and body fluids) flowing in the jing luo system (through which the vital energy flows, regulated by the acupoints of the body), which is central to the TCM theory, cannot be proven scientifically.The arguments and counter arguments go on and on.Even the vast volumes of clinical studies on herbal medicine carried out by the researchers in China are greeted with scepticism.Why?According to Professor Leung Ping Chung, a prominent surgeon and professor of orthopaedics and traumatology at the Hongkong Chinese University Medical School, this is because the Chinese researchers do not always adhere to internationally accepted methodologies of clinical research.The result is that much of their published work is now being repeated elsewhere in accordance to internationally acceptable methodologies, before they are scientifically admissible.Another longstanding problem is the lack of scientific understanding of the herbs themselves despite extensive documentation of their medicinal properties and uses in ancient texts. For example, what are their chemical compositions? Which of the many ingredients contained in each herb are active?As Prof Leung notes, much[Continued on facing page]Interest brewing up for TCM outside China[From previous page]of TCM was developed before the advent of modern science and medicine.Even less is known about the decoctions -- proprietary medicines made from a handful to a dozen or more of specially prepared herbs -- and their physiological impact.While many believe that TCM works, explaining convincingly how it works to the practitioners of Western medicine that control the mainstream health-care profession outside China is a different matter.Yet they must. Especially if they want to win over the agency which guards the door to the world's largest health food and herbal products market: the United States Food and Drugs Administration.As China's late Premier Zhou Enlai once observed: ""Until science can explain how TCM works, there will always be doubters and sceptics.""A SHOT AT THE MAINSTREAM MARKETCHINA exported 5 billion yuan (about S$1 billion) worth of TCM products last year, over half in the form of low value-added medicinal herbs and the rest split between extracts and proprietary products, according to SATCM's Dr Shen.Given a global herbal products market which stands at about US$20 billion (S$35 billion) a year now and grows at about 10 per cent a year, this means China has only 3 per cent of the pie.Still, with a 50 billion yuan domestic TCM market at home, even leading TCM pharmaceutical companies in China -- like Beijing's 300-year-old Tong Ren Tang, with annual sales of about 2 billion yuan -- seem too absorbed at home to focus on markets abroad.But there is growing interest from overseas, with ""international visitors crowding the SATCM's corridors"", says Dr Shen.Pharmaceutical giants such as Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson have all come a-calling, keen on joint research and development programmes. He adds that there are already more than 20 joint drug development projects with French partners.""We have three herbal products under FDA trial and evaluation; one is for lung cancer,"" he discloses.The rest of Asia is also awakening to the potential of TCM in the global economy.The Hongkong government has not been coy in declaring its intention to become an ""international TCM centre"". Not to be outdone, Taiwan says it wants to be a ""TCM Technology Island"".And enterprises such as Hongkong's New World Development, Taiwan's President Group and Sun Ten, and Singapore's Eu Yan Sang have all formed joint ventures in China, either for TCM research or to secure the source of top-grade herbal materials.As China, which will join the World Trade Organisation later this year, takes its place among the economic powers, will its thousands-year-old medical prowess win global acceptance as well?NEXT WEEK: Will Hongkong be the international centre for TCM?TCM: Now and the futureInterest in joint R&D programmes with China expressed by pharmaceutical giants such as Merck and Johnson & Johnson 20 joint drug development projects with French partners Hongkong wants to become an ""international TCM centre"" Taiwan wants to become a ""TCM Technology Island"".

50,1051.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Cupping wins younger fans; Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps is not the only athlete who finds the healing therapy beneficial,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners here say they have seen a growing number of athletes, fitness enthusiasts and working professionals turn to the healing therapy of cupping. This is even before many more people throughout the world came to know of the practice after American swimming champion Michael Phelps was photographed at the ongoing Rio Olympics sporting the purplish-red marks - a tell-tale sign that he has received the therapy. Cupping is believed to relieve muscle tension by improving blood circulation, which helps to stimulate the qi, or the ""vital energy"" of the body. The process involves placing on the body inverted cups in which a partial vacuum is induced by heat or a vacuum suction pump. Bruises, ranging from light pink to dull red, appear because the suction causes the blood capillaries under the skin to rupture. S-League football star Jermaine Pennant has been seeking the traditional Chinese healing therapy of cupping for years, even when he was playing in England and Spain, where the practice is probably less common than in Singapore.My muscle soreness normally takes four to five days to go away. But when I do cupping, it goes away the next day. FITNESS INSTRUCTOR ROZANNE YAP ""I believe it brings blood and circulates (blood) to the area of the muscle that is damaged as new blood will repair it better,"" says the 33-year-old Tampines Rovers player, who last received the therapy two weeks ago to release the tension in his back. According to TCM practitioners, cupping is effective for various ailments such as eczema and influenza, and muscle aches and pains, as well as for better performance. Ms Jaime Cheong, general manager of the Singapore Athletics Association (SAA), says: ""We send our athletes to TCM chain Kin Teck Tong for cupping treatment to accelerate their recovery and for better performance."" Long associated as a preferred treatment for older folks, TCM has found a younger clientele in recent years. Kin Teck Tong reports a 95.6 per cent increase over the past two years in customers - mostly in their 30s - opting for cupping. One such convert is national sprinter Smriti Menon, 18, who has been seeking TCM treatments such as cupping, acupuncture and massages over the past three years. ""I was a bit apprehensive about trying TCM because I hadn't heard much about it, but I trusted my coach who recommended it. The treatments help to loosen tight muscles and prevent injury,"" says Menon, who trains five days a week and goes for TCM treatment about once every three weeks. A spokesman for Kin Teck Tong's Sports Hub branch says many customers ask for cupping treatment after engaging in sports and fitness activities in the vicinity. The chain has also been providing free TCM treatments - including cupping - to selected sportsmen from SAA and the Basketball Association of Singapore in the past year. Aegle TCM Wellness Clinique's clientele is largely made up of young working professionals in their 30s and 40s who lead active lifestyles. One of its physicians, Ms He Dandan, says: ""Mixed-martial arts fighters, marathon runners and triathletes come to our clinic to do cupping and acupuncture to help relieve sports fatigue and injury and improve performance."" At Raffles Chinese Medicine, physician Chua Hui Zi says more young professionals are going for cupping to relieve neck and back pains due to long hours sitting in front of the computer and tilting the head when using mobile phones. Fitness instructor Rozanne Yap, 28, finds that her monthly cupping sessions, along with other TCM treatments, help to ease her muscle aches. ""I experience much faster muscle recovery when I do cupping. My muscle soreness normally takes four to five days to go away. But when I do cupping, it goes away the next day,"" says Ms Yap, who runs fitness studio Energize Movement. From a Western medicine perspective, cupping may help relieve pain in sore muscles with painful trigger points, says Dr Chiam Tut Fu, a consultant sports medicine physician at Pacific Healthcare. This leads to relaxation of the muscles, which improves their function and strength. Dr Chiam adds: ""An athlete with sore muscles due to hard training or injury may benefit from cupping. Otherwise, it will not be of any value."" Dr Lim Ang Tee of Changi Sports Medicine Centre says there are some studies investigating the effectiveness of cupping for relieving muscular aches and pains that appear promising. But he adds that there has yet to be large-scale quality studies published on the therapy. Going by Phelps' haul of at least four gold medals at the ongoing Olympics - where at age 31, he is older than many other competitors - cupping may have given the champ a boost, even if it is just all in the mind. Dr Chiam says: ""There is a lot of psychological influences in sports and if the athlete feels he or she has an edge with any form of therapy, that added confidence translates to better performance.""Swimmer Michael Phelps , national sprinter Smriti Menon, fitness instructor Rozanne Yap and footballer Jermaine Pennant (above) all sport the tell-tale marks of cupping."
51,1052.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Chinese medicine gaining favour in Britain;Acupuncture clinic gets royal backing as more Britons recognise worth of traditional Chinese cures,"Neo Hui MinLONDON - Tucked at a corner of the Lambeth Hospital in South London is a little clinic where queues of local residents turn up to get needled.It was here 13 years ago that acupuncture was first given a chance in Britain's government- managed, taxpayer-funded National Healthcare Service. This month, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture was given another boost when the enterprising place called The Gateway Clinic won the biannual Good Practice in Integrated Health award given by the Prince of Wales Foundation for Integrated Health. In his speech, Prince Charles gave strong endorsement for complementary medicine when he said: 'I would suggest that there is a correspondingly urgent need to see a much greater expansion of integrated approaches, and not simply for people who can afford them, in order to deal with the enormous challenges surrounding us.'He called the clinic 'a very good example of a service which is not only helping to fill in gaps in conventional care, but is also addressing problems that conventional approaches don't always answer'.TCM in general and acupuncture in particular are not only gaining acceptance among royalty, but also among a growing section of the British population.The British Acupuncture Council (BAC) has noted a pronounced growth within the past five years. An estimated 20 per cent of people here use complementary medicine, and among the four most well-used forms is acupuncture.The council's chief executive officer, Mr Michael O'Farrell, told The Straits Times that this sudden surge in popularity could be attributed partly to the British government's interest in acupuncture since 1999.More people are also jumping into the business. From seven colleges offering acupuncture classes six years ago, there are now 14.Mainstream general practitioners are also placing their trust in TCM.Mr O'Farrell said: 'We now know that nearly 50 per cent of general practitioners refer some of their patients to complementary medicine. This would not have been so a few years ago.'The popularity could be illustrated by the queues at the Gateway Clinic and the fact that there is a four-month waiting list.The clinic's team of five acupuncturists and 25 volunteers tends to 400 patients a month.The clinic started out about a decade ago by using acupuncture to treat HIV patients. Gradually, it gained a reputation for treating such cases, as well as helping in the detoxification process of drug addicts and the treatment of Hepatitis C patients.These days, it has diversified its services.Mr Dominique Joire, manager and senior acupuncturist at the clinic, told The Straits Times: 'Other than our regular HIV patients, most of our referred patients suffer from chronic illnesses like migraines and backaches. Doctors tend to send in people they don't know what to do with.'Mrs Malika Harrak is one such patient. For years, she had been suffering from backaches, some so severe that she had trouble getting up from a chair.She said: 'I tried everything. I've seen doctors, I went for physiotherapy. But after several sessions, the physiotherapist said to me: 'I really don't know what to do for you anymore'. So she referred me to get some acupuncture and after only about six sessions, I was feeling much better.'To regulate the growing TCM practice, two working groups - one on Chinese herbal medicine and one on acupuncture - have submitted recommendations to the government. The regulations are expected to go into operation by late 2005.Meanwhile, the Gateway team is planning to push for the expansion of its services to other hospitals in Britain."

Mr Richard Lee, honorary secretary for philanthropic society Ngee Ann Kongsi, says of Ngee Ann TCM Centre at Balestier Road: ""We wanted to do a Chinese version of Mount Elizabeth's specialists clinic: traditional ways of preparing medicine but with modern convenience.""Mr Peter Law, manager of seven-month-old TCMS Healthcare, says that the young today place their trust in Western medicine as the standard of TCM so far has been erratic, with no yardstick to measure the physicians by.But under the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Bill passed in November last year, Chinese sinsehs will have to be registered to practise starting from next year.Adds Mr Law: ""We hope that by offering a higher standard of TCM, we can give the public a wider choice.""Quality is imperative for both operators, who hire only top physicians from China who must be ""professors or lecturers"", says Mr Law.TCMS Healthcare, which is co-managed by the Parkway Group Healthcare, selects physicians trained in Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, one of the pioneers and leaders in TCM education in China.The physicians also make their rounds at the three hospitals under the Parkway Group -- East Shore, Gleneagles and Mount Elizabeth -- if there are requests from patients there.Ngee Ann TCM Centre, on the other hand, is staffed by three veteran doctors from Beijing's renowned Xi Yuan Hospital of China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.These include the hospital's chief physician and its head of the gynaecology department, who are here on short stints.They will be replaced by peers of a similar standing when their attachments end.Although they practise TCM, all the top TCM professionals in China are also trained in Western medicine, which allows them to combine the two approaches in their work.Says Professor Jiang Kun, who heads the gynaecology department at Xi Yuan Hospital: ""Not all illnesses can be treated by TCM. And the Western approach alone may not be better in all cases. They should complement each other, just as how you need two legs to walk.""Adds general practitioner Huang Fei, who is a physician and acupuncturist at Chinese Medical Hospital of Suzhou: ""We know how to read X-rays, blood test results and so on because of our training in Western medicine. There is no such thing as one is better than the other. As long as an illness can be cured, that's good.""Dr Fei Guo Quan, an acupuncturist at TCMS Healthcare who is a consultant acupuncturist at Suzhou TCM Hospital and a lecturer at Nanjing University of TCM, was expecting resistance when she was first posted here.She says: ""Many people in China don't believe in TCM. They trust Western medicine, where your problem can be solved with one jab or one pill. Surprisingly, the level of acceptance here is wider than I expected.""Technology plays a big part in the daily operations of the two clinics.Ngee Ann TCM Centre invested $10,000 in a Chinese medicinal brewing machine, which extracts the essence of the prescribed herbs and packs them in sterilised pouches, saving patients time and hassle.The dispensing machine at TCMS Healthcare, on the other hand, packs medicinal herbs in powder form into handy sachets which patients then empty into hot water.Says Mr Lee: ""The traditional way of preparing Chinese medicine takes a lot of time and effort. The young, in particular, don't even know how to go about doing it. The machine saves them that hassle.""Response to both clinics has been very encouraging so far.About 800 to 1,000 patients have been dropping by Ngee Ann TCM Centre every month since it opened in November last year, while TCMS Healthcare sees about 500 consultations a month.But the specialists at Ngee Ann TCM Centre hope that more people will tap their expertise.Says Prof Jiang candidly: ""I head the gynaecology department back home. But over here, most of the patients come to me with common ailments such as the flu. Of course we can treat that, but I feel under-utilised.""Both operators view each other as collaborators rather than competitors.Says Mr Lee: If you have more professional TCM centres offering quality healthcare, the standard of TCM in Singapore will improve. And everyone stands to gain from that."""

He noted that acupuncture was already a wellaccepted and regulated field in the West.""In Singapore, you get needles poked in all parts of your body and there is no legislation, no regulation whatsoever."" But he was cautious about having the Government move into other aspects of TCM, pointing out that no country has regulated the industry.Even in China, where there are top TCM universities, the Government regulates with ""a light hand"".In Singapore, his ministry's expertise on the subject was limited.  And local practitioners had, till lately, resisted working together in a coordinating committee.He noted that the regulation of the medical profession in the West through ministers and regulatory bodies was a fairly recent practice.  They all started as self-regulated professions.""We should encourage the TCM practitioners in Singapore to go the same way. And even if we decide to legislate, we'll do it step by step.""BG (NS) Yeo was responding to four MPs who called for a more hands-on approach in dealing with TCM to protect the many Singaporeans who turned to Chinese herbs and Chinese sinsehs. Health GPC chairman Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC) called for a TCM Council to be set up for more accountability, while Mr Lau Ping Sum (Ang Mo Kio GRC) called for minimum standards of entry into the profession.Mr Loh and Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC) also noted that foreign charlatans were practising TCM in private homes, hotel rooms and even in HDB estates.Replying, the minister acknowledged the ""sterling service"" provided by the TCM community, and noted that it was also being practised increasingly in the West.The way ahead for Singapore was to study the experiences of China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong and Japan and see what could be done to improve training and standards here. The minister also said that a committee headed by his junior minister, Dr Aline Wong, was drafting a report following its trip to China, where it met several TCM groups.""I think, towards the end of the year, we should be able to produce something for public discussion. But this is not something that I want to rush into."" For now, he suggested the TCM community police itself, including identifying charlatans, setting minimum standards for entry, training, auditing and certification.BG Yeo also said there were difficulties in integrating Eastern and Western medicine in Singapore, as called for by Mr Peh.There has been little real scientific integration of East and West in medicine so far, he noted, as Western medicine took an analytical approach, while TCM was a holistic one. TCM's role ""We should look squarely into the matter and find ways and means to resolve the differences, rather than try and avoid it. As pointed out by Minister BG George Yeo, in the course of treatment, some cancer patients also take Chinese herbs. They do not reveal this to the physician or oncologist because some Western-trained doctors are sceptical about Chinese physicians' medical treatment.""-Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC). ""I believe TCM has a role to play. It can complement Western medicine.  But to date, the ministry has adopted a very detached stance. It has encouraged the various TCM associations to amalgamate, set standards and self-regulate. I think one question we have to ask ourselves is whether the development of TCM is beneficial to Singaporeans. If the answer is ""yes', then I think the Government should take a more pro-active role.""-Dr Wan Soon Bee (Brickworks GRC)."

Lee Hui Chieh finds out more","With the increasing acceptance of acupuncture in mainstream medicine, a new form known as medical acupuncture has developed.Medical acupuncture is practised by medical doctors, and it is based on conventional Western medicine principles, rather than on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory.The acupuncture needles are stuck at any point within an acupuncture area, rather than the fixed and specific acupuncture points that TCM-trained acupuncturists use. As more studies indicated the benefits of acupuncture, doctors developed a more scientific version known as medical acupuncture, which does not use TCM theory.Dr Kong Keng He, a senior consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's (TTSH) rehabilitation medicine department, explained that it was 'very hard' for doctors to reconcile Western medicine with the philosophical concepts of TCM.'But there's enough scientific evidence to indicate how acupuncture works, so we can practise acupuncture without relying on TCM theory,' said Dr Kong, who also heads TTSH's Complementary Integrative Medicine Clinic and practises medical acupuncture there.In TCM, any disorder and its symptoms, such as back pain, is the result of an obstruction of the body's qi - or energy circulation.When the energy channels, known as meridians, are blocked, according to the theory, there is an imbalance of elements inside the body, causing illness.TCM acupuncture relieves illness and pain by clearing the clogged meridians, and restoring the body's energy flow and balance.This is done by sticking fine needles at the relevant acupoints in the body. The body has numerous acupoints, each of which serves a specific and different function, even though one point may be just 1cm away from another.In Western medicine, however, back pain may be explained by say, a crooked spine pressing on neighbouring nerves.The scientific explanation for how acupuncture works?The acupuncture points are located within nerve-rich areas in the body. Inserting needles stimulate the nerves to produce chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which then instruct the brain to produce other substances that relieve the pain.A needle stuck into a nerve-rich region should be able to achieve this purpose, so it is not necessary to pick a fixed point as a TCM-trained physician would, Dr Kong said.Since nearly a half century ago, Western medicine has also come up with the concept of trigger points, or weakened points in muscles that develop over time, causing people much pain.Even when doctors inject these trigger points with empty syringes, the pain goes away.About 80 per cent of trigger points correspond to acupuncture points, said Dr Kong, so a form of acupuncture has long been practised in Western medicine.Mr T.H. Tan, a 72-year-old retiree, tried medical acupuncture at TTSH in May, after suffering constant back and leg pain with no known cause. He said the pain persisted for more than a month despite painkillers: 'It was so bad that I couldn't lift up my right leg to get into cabs when I wanted to go out.'After five acupuncture sessions at TTSH, his leg pain has disappeared and he is more mobile. His back still aches sometimes, especially just after he wakes up, but the pain has lessened significantly.Asked how he felt about having undergone a non-traditional and less-known form of acupuncture, he said: 'I have no confidence in TCM physicians, and I find a Western-trained doctor in a hospital more reliable.'E-mail: huichieh@sph.com.sg"

Tuina therapy, or Chinese therapeutic massage, uses the same principles as acupuncture, except that hands and fingers are used instead of needles, said Ms Poh Yu Min, a TCM physician at Raffles Chinese Medicine at Raffles Hospital.  The massage is done to remove blockages along the pathways or meridians of the body, and stimulate the flow of qi or energy, she said. But tuina therapy is not for everyone. For instance, people with suspected fractures and elderly people with osteoporosis should not try it as their bones may get injured in the process, said Ms Poh. It is also not recommended for those with tumours, tuberculosis, bone infections or severe heart and lung disease. In such cases, Chinese herbal medication and acupuncture will be a better choice of treatment, she said. For the rest of us, Raffles Chinese Medicine offers a TCM Acupuncture Package for Sub-Health ($254.65 for four sessions) and a Relieve Your Work-related Stress And Pain With TCM package. The latter includes four sessions of stress-relief acupuncture and six sessions each of stress-relief meridian acupressure, general musculoskeletal pain management and tuina massage therapy. Prices for this package vary, depending on whether you need herbal medicine, for instance. Individual tuina sessions are $50, while the pain management sessions start from $55 each.IN A STATE OF SUB-HEALTH The treatments are aimed at addressing sub-health, or the grey state, which is defined in TCM as a borderline state between being healthy and being ill. You will need to first consult a TCM physician to see if you are suitable for them. This consultation costs between $40 and $50. ""If left unattended, the sub-health state gradually weakens the body's immune system and allows pathogens - infectious agents or germs - to attack the body easily,"" said Ms Poh. ""In today's society, the main causes of sub-health are occupational stress and undesirable lifestyle habits or behaviour,"" she added. People who constantly feel tired, depressed, agitated or suffer from insomnia, poor memory, aches and shortness of breath, may be in a state of sub-health, she said. At Raffles, sub-health is managed with a combination of herbal medicine to boost immunity, and acupuncture to relieve aches, insomnia and other related symptoms. Several other hospitals, including Singapore General Hospital, National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, also offer TCM treatments.Joyce Teo"

This is so that he can avoid giving you herbs that have a similar effect on the body.""This can compound the effect and may have adverse results,"" she says.Even if the effects of the Western and Chinese medicine do not clash, it is best to take them at least two to four hours apart, she adds.A survey last June of 700 parents at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital points to the worrying trend that 37 per cent of parents give their sick children over-the-counter Chinese medicine, usually without consulting a Chinese physician, but on recommendations of friends and relatives.Usually, the Chinese physician prescribes Chinese medicine according to the following three factors: * THEIR DIFFERENT DEGREES OF HEATINESS A ""heaty"" (yang) herb raises your body temperature and improves blood circulation, but this is not recommended for those prone to sore throats and ulcers.A ""cooling"" (yin) herb is for those who need to hydrate their body. But this is not for those prone to cold hands and feet, a bloated stomach and diarrhoea.Those that fall in between are known as average (zhong) herbs. * THEIR VARYING TASTES Tastes can sometimes be categorised according to the herb's use.For instance, herbs used for strengthening the body (bu) often taste sweet (tian).Those for colds and to improve blood circulation often have a pungent, peppermint-like (xin) taste.Those to remove excess water from the body (for instance, removing a heavy and bloated feeling) are often bitter (ku).Herbs used to relieve heatiness and phlegm tend to be saltish (xian) while those for preventing diarrhoea, sweatiness and thirst are often sourish (suan).Some herbs have more than one taste. For instance, ginseng tastes sweet and slightly-bitter. * WHICH BODY ORGANS THEY WORK ON Even though these names are the same as those of Western medicine, they refer to quite different organs.The heart system includes the ""thinking"" part of the brain (si xiang), tongue and blood circulation.The liver system is responsible for the emotional part of the brain (qing xu), blood storage and eyes.The spleen system includes digestion and prevention of internal bleeding.The lung system is responsible for qi (for normal functioning and building up the immune system) and breathing.The kidney system is responsible for reproduction, general growth and development, the bone and joint system, the ability to breathe deeply, hair growth and water circulation. * If you have any questions on this topic, please e-mail them to stlife@sph.com.sg We will get the expert to answer them next week. PREVIEW: What's coming up next OVER the next month, Sunday Plus will run a series on the 4,000-year-old practice of traditional Chinese medicine.Next week's series will focus on herbs that can also be used as food, and the following week will zero in on traditional Chinese massages.The series is supported by the Office for Continuing Education at the National University of Singapore, which runs a seven-week course for the public to raise their awareness about this ancient form of healing.Those interested can call the NUS Office for Continuing Education on 874-7956 or 338-8400 or e-mail: oceadm1@nus.edu.sg"
57,1058.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Prick me for beauty's sake; Acupuncture, the ancient Chinese medical procedure, is increasingly being used for aesthetic reasons and to treat problems like infertility and hair loss","Since ancient times, acupuncture has been used to treat ailments. Now, there is beauty acupuncture.Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practice, is well known for treating illnesses by the insertion of needles at specified sites of the body. Many people here go for such treatment for ailments such as arthritis and back pain.Now, people are also turning to the acupuncturist for aesthetic matters such as skin problems, weight management and hair loss. MsQiau Tien Ru, a senior acupuncturist at the National University Hospital's acupuncture clinic, said that in TCM, obesity problems result from an imbalance within the body caused by the malfunctioning of the 'spleen and liver systems'.In this respect, she said, TCM's understanding of these organs differs from the concept of the liver and spleen in Western medicine. So are the prescribed treatments. For weight loss, MsWang Xiao Lan, a TCM consultant physician at Raffles Chinese Medicine, said that acupuncture stimulates the meridians or invisible energy pathways to unblock the passage of blood so as to enhance digestion and increase one's metabolism.She said such treatment can be used to suppress appetite but stressed that it does not cause diarrhoea or involve any starvation diets.Ms Qiau said beauty acupuncture is becoming more popular. Here, acupuncture is used to help improve the skin condition by promoting blood circulation, stimulating the formation of more collagen and rebalancing the whole body.When Ms Cheryl Siew, 32, returned to Singapore from a two-week holiday in the United States earlier this year, she began to suffer from a bad case of acne. Her face became red and blotchy and there were a lot of acne and blackheads around her chin area.A friend recommended that she consult Dr Koh Chin Aik at Specialist Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre.Ms Siew, a business development manager in the training industry, said that she believed in traditional Chinese medicine and was happy to see the TCM practitioner.At each visit, Dr Koh, who holds a doctoral degree in acupuncture from Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, performed acupuncture on her upper back. He also prescribed herbal remedies for her to drink.At the end of five sessions, MsSiew's skin had cleared considerably.Explained in TCM terms, the causes of acne appear to be not just skin deep. Both Dr Koh and Ms Qiau said that acne is often due to the accumulation of 'damp heat' which rises from the organs and causes blockage and subsequent eruptions of acne.They said acupuncture can be used to target the causes of the heat accumulation, resulting in the acne condition clearing up.Acne patients are also advised to avoid 'heaty' food. Ms Qiau said that fried, spicy and fatty foods are regarded in TCM as 'heaty' foods that can trigger pimples.Ms Tang Yue, a TCM physician at Eu Yan Sang Specialist TCM Centre, said people with acne problems tend to have 'heaty' body constitutions and these foods therefore exacerbate the condition.She added that on hot days, one should drink cooling Chinese herbal beverages such as chrysanthemum tea or dandelion tisane.Dr Chee Yew Wen, the medical director of Wen and Weng Medical Group, said he does not dispense advice on 'heaty' or 'cooling' foods to patients with skin problems because these concepts do not exist in Western medicine.He has had patients who consult him after the alternative medicine treatments they tried for conditions such as acne and hair loss proved ineffective. Generally, however, he does not discourage patients from following Eastern medicine practices as long as there is no harm.Dr Chee said: 'Eastern medicine has a long history and many people are deeply rooted in their cultures.'I prefer proven results from scientific trials but I respect other people's beliefs and decisions with regards to alternative medicine.' With regard to one's hair, Ms Tang said that in TCM, the condition of the hair is viewed as a direct reflection of the condition of the blood, liver and kidney. Thus, hair thinning or hair loss may be caused by problems such as spleen-stomach deficiency, kidney and liver deficiency, as well as heat and dampness accumulation in the body.Serene, a 43-year-old housewife, saw Dr Koh for a bald patch at the back of her head. About the size of a 10 cent coin, it had been a recurrent problem since her late 30s.Dr Koh performed acupuncture on her bald patch as well as on her neck and prescribed herbal medicine. Serene's hair grew back.But when asked if she would recommend acupuncture for people suffering from hair loss, she laughed and said that she would only recommend it to people with a high threshold for pain like herself.'The pain from the needles was not unbearable but it's certainly not for the faint-hearted,' she said.Jovanda Bistonjbiston@sph.com.sgWHAT IT CAN FIXObesity: This results from an imbalance in the body caused by the malfunctioning of the spleen and liver systems. Acupuncture stimulates meridians to unblock the passage of blood to enhance digestion and metabolism. Acne: Often due to the accumulation of 'damp heat'.

The course will be conducted in Mandarin, but the OCE has plans for future courses to be in English.It will be held once a week on Saturday afternoons. The cost will be $ 250 per person, or $ 200 for senior citizens above the age of 60.About 50 people will be accepted for the course, which will be taught by experts from the Association for Promoting Chinese Medicines, Singapore Chinese Medical Studies and other institutes.The Association for Promoting Chinese Medicines is one of two local groups that run a six-year part-time acupuncture accreditation programme, which is recognised by the Ministry of Health.The association's president, Mr Sia Bak Chiang, said that people need to know more about TCM because it was getting more attention recently.""With the Government and media paying more attention to TCM, more people want to know the benefits and whether it really works,"" he said.The idea for the course was mooted by Haw Par Corporation's president and chief executive, Dr Hong Hai, an adviser to the OCE.An ardent believer in TCM, he said such a course would help more people make informed choices about whether or not to seek TCM help for their ailments.""If people decide after the course that TCM doesn't work for them, they won't lose anything. But if they decide that it does, then they may gain something and live happier lives,"" he said.The Health Ministry, which will register all acupuncturists by next year, will do the same for all TCM practitioners in three to five years' time.The OCE will also launch a more advanced acupuncture course in three months' time. Led by Associate Professor Lee Tat Leang, chief of anaesthesia at the National University of Singapore, it will teach Chinese physicians and doctors trained in Western medicine about acupuncture in anaesthetics and therapy.Those interested in the basic awareness course may call the OCE at 874-7956.

A temporary board and acupuncture exam syllabus may also be unveiled by early next year. These changes will not only formalise the registration of acupuncturists by the middle of next year, they may also outlaw ill-trained practitioners by barring them from practising at a later stage.Speaking to The Straits Times yesterday, Parliamentary Secretary (Health) Chan Soo Sen said the aim was to register all TCM practitioners in three to five years' time.Non-acupuncturists may also be required to sit for examinations by 2002.And a professional council may also be set up later to oversee the 1,807 TCM practitioners here, he added.Over the weekend, he met the Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Coordinating Committee (STCMOCC), which was formed in 1995 as an umbrella body for the eight TCM groups here.He said higher standards were needed because many people, including the young, now seek acupuncture and therapeutic massage for pain resulting from golf and tennis games.However, many TCM practitioners learn the trade informally and their skills are passed from generation to generation.This gave rise, he said, to ""black sheep whose misconduct undermined the image of the TCM community and patients' interests"".The new examination, he said, will ensure that the public is protected from them. Those who fail it will have to attend classes to upgrade their skills.But experienced practitioners may be exempted from taking it.Preparations for the classes were now being made and experts from China were reviewing the curriculum, he said.Pitched at a diploma level, the examination will meet the standards set by the STCMOCC's six-year TCM course.It may be conducted in English and other languages as not all acupuncturists are Chinese.""As long as practitioners are willing to practise, they will be given every chance to do so,"" Mr Chan said.The Ministry of Health is planning a mission to China and Hongkong in October to learn from their experiences.Mr Chan said he hoped that the STCMOCC would help the ministry to chart the future of TCM here.The TCM community has, in recent years, been plagued by in-fighting between the different schools of thought.The method of pricking the skin with a needle, for example, is a contentious issue as it differs from school to school.Mr Chan said: ""It is my hope that they can look beyond their differences and work together to raise the image of TCM and put the public interest first."""
60,1061.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Facial acupuncture: Pin cushion for beauty; Forget Botox. Facial acupuncture is being offered to treat cosmetic and health issues,"When people think of acupuncture, they usually imagine long, fine needles being inserted into their hands or legs. The face, with its delicate skin, is one of the last body parts which come to mind. Despite this, facial acupuncture can help to resolve cosmetic and underlying health problems, said traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners. Eu Yan Sang physician Anita Pee said it is a customised treatment based on the person's condition and offers a holistic approach to managing skin problems.  She said: ""Facial acupuncture aims to achieve good skin by improving the body's constitution and adjusting the internal environment of the body."" The company introduced this treatment at selected clinics in April. Acupuncturists are registered with and regulated by the TCM Practitioners Board under the Ministry of Health. By stimulating acupoints on the face, as well as related acupoints on the body - such as the hands and legs - acupuncture increases blood circulation to the face. This improves the skin's radiance and promotes collagen production to fill fine lines, said Ms Pee. According to TCM theory, the facial acupoints are part of channels known as meridians, which link the surface of the body to the internal organs and other body parts. Ms Pee said: ""In TCM, the body is seen as a whole and skin problems reflect disharmony within the body. Thus, skin conditions are treated by addressing not only the visible symptoms, but also the root cause of the problem."" For example, skin pigmentation is often associated with poor qi (vital energy) and blood flow to the facial region, or deficiencies in the spleen and kidneys. Needles are therefore inserted into selected acupoints which help to promote the smooth flow of qi and blood, as well as strengthen the spleen and kidneys, said Ms Pee. She added that facial acupuncture can also help to resolve issues such as dark eye bags, acne, dull skin, wrinkles and a puffy face, as well as stimulate circulation in the area for better skin complexion. A suggested treatment plan would be 12 sessions, once or twice a week. Prices start from $68 per session at the firm's selected clinics. It also offers its facial acupuncture service at the Grand Hyatt's Damai Spa, at $158 per session. Each session lasts about half an hour, excluding consultation. Meanwhile, a facial acupuncture session costs about $100 at Raffles Chinese Medicine (RCM), the TCM arm of Raffles Medical Group, said RCM physician Ong Fang Ying. The clinic has seen patients in their 20s to 30s. But most of her customers are women in their 30s to 50s, she added. RCM has been offering the treatment for more than eight years. Ms Ong said that treatment plans vary - some patients need 10 to 20 sessions to see results, while others need only five to six. Ms Pee said some people are concerned that facial acupuncture is painful and worry if they will be able to resume normal activities after the session. But the procedure is simple and relatively painless. However, despite the purported benefits of facial acupuncture, the treatment is not for everyone. Facial acupuncture is not suitable for people with skin infections, open wounds, tumours, bleeding disorders, serious health conditions and acute diseases. In cases of severe acne, acupuncture will be focused on body acupoints, rather than the face. Also, acupuncture has still not been scientifically proven. Undergraduate Sheryl Lim, 24, said that facial acupuncture helped to get rid of the acne on her face. She went for the treatment once a month, over half a year. She said: ""My pores are still oily but the pimples disappeared after one to two weeks. I would go back again for aesthetic purposes.""  When I was asked to try out a free facial acupuncture session by Eu Yan Sang, I was hesitant, to say the least. I was apprehensive about having needles stuck into my face. Surprisingly, the treatment was simple and painless. When I entered the treatment room in Damai Spa at Grand Hyatt, I was greeted by physician Anita Pee. The session started with a detailed consultation. Ms Pee asked me many questions, and checked my tongue and pulse. This allowed her to diagnose my body condition and constitution, based on TCM theory. She said I had high levels of heatiness associated with my stomach and liver, and this would be treated during the session. I changed and removed my make-upbefore I lay down on the acupuncture bed and waited rather nervously. When the treatment started, though, I began to relax. This was despite 11 needles, each about 0.2mm in diameter, being inserted into acupoints on my forehead, temples, cheeks and lower facial area. Needles were also stuck into my hands and feet. Ms Pee adjusted the needles and administered electro- acupuncture, where electricity is passed in pulses to provide stimulation of acupoints. There was a dull ache in the acupoints on my foot. She said this meant that blood circulation had been stimulated. The insertion of the other needles was slightly ticklish, without much pain. The needles were left in my skin for half an hour. When they were removed, a facial massage was done with a jade roller. I enjoyed this. I could not feel any tangible benefits from the session, but I slept very well that night - whether it was from the facial acupuncture or fatigue due to the sleepless night before, I could not tell."

Speaking in Mandarin, Mr Lee Kim Leong, principal of the training college in Toa Payoh, said: ""With this agreement, we hope to upgrade the standards of traditional Chinese medicine here.""In future, our physicians here can also visit Guangzhou to share knowledge in their own fields of specialisation."".Professor Qiu He Ming, vice-president of the Guangzhou College of Traditional Medicine, led three other professors to sign an agreement with the training college for a long-term exchange programme yesterday.Prof Qiu and his team were also invited here to evaluate the standards of the College.Said Prof Qiu in Mandarin: ""The college has adequate facilities, such as its vast library collection of 20,000 books.""Its systematic teaching methods also guarantee the quality of physicians.""He added that trainee physicians studying at the college also get useful practical training treating patients at the Chung Hwa Free Clinic in Toa Payoh.This clinic is run by the Singapore Chinese Physicians' Association.The training college was set up here in 1953. Already, 1,200 students have graduated.Students undergo a five-year training stint which adds up to about 3,300 hours of study.Chinese physicians here can also pursue a more advanced qualification in traditional medicine in China's colleges. The more popular colleges are in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Nanjing.Said Mr Lee: ""We hope that with both our hard work and the support of the Guangzhou College, the college here can give a more co-ordinated form of training for Chinese physicians."""

It is the first time the full complement of TCM is being offered in a public medical institution. TCM clinics at others, such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital, offer acupuncture at most and this has to be done at the clinic.This is the closest collaboration yet between Eastern and Western medicine, said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan yesterday. And if it takes off successfully, such centres may make an appearance in other hospitals.But they will be considered a separate entity from the hospital, and the TCM practitioners have to be given the green light from the patient's Western doctor to go into the wards.The clinic can also see walk-in cases who will not need a doctor's referral.Ang Mo Kio Hospital's chief executive, Dr Chong Weng Chiew, said the revised requirements will mean a more coordinated management of patient care under both Eastern and Western medicine.However, Mr Khaw said, this co-existence does not mean the two practices are integrating. Even the Chinese themselves do not believe this is possible.'During the 1980s, Beijing was pushing it and everybody merrily went along, trying to integrate the East and the West. Ten years later, according to the Nanjing TCM University, their conclusion was it doesn't work.'To use a Chinese expression, zhong xi he bing, liang bai ju sang (integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicines will result in both sides losing out).'But, that does not mean the two cannot co-exist or collaborate, he said.Indeed, to achieve a harmonious situation between Western-trained and Eastern-trained doctors, there has to be better understanding between the two. Such understanding helps develop mutual respect.As part of the deal, the hospital's doctors will be trained in areas of TCM treatment, while the Chinese physicians will be taught evidence-based research in TCM herbs.Dr Chong said: 'With this strict criteria and assurance of quality, we'll be able to give our patients the very best of both the East and the West.'His hospital was the first here to have an acupuncture research clinic, which it set up in 1995, as part of a move by the authorities to ensure good practice and evaluate the potency of acupuncture.A year later, Hua Mei Acupuncture clinic of the Tsao Foundation opened at Alexandra Hospital. Last month, the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association opened its first TCM clinic in Jurong. It plans to have three more by the end of the year.Though the TCM treatment in the wards will be limited, it will be a bonus to patients like Madam L.S. Goh, a retiree, who fractured her hip and asked for acupuncture because 'I have faith in the treatment' as it helped her frozen shoulder.She has been having it every day at the hospital's acupuncture research clinic except over Chinese New Year.'Now I can take very small steps with the help of a walking stick. During physiotherapy, I'm able to climb one or two steps,' said the 70-year-old."

Shelagh Mahbubani finds out,"In 1991, the frozen body of a 5,300-year-old man was found in the Alps.A close look by scientists threw up a remarkable find: tattoo marks at traditional acupuncture points on his body.This led them to deduce that the man - who appeared to have suffered from arthritis and was about 45 when he died - used a type of acupuncture to relieve pain.More than five millennia later, people around the world still rely on acupuncture - a major component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) - to fight pain and illness. Acupuncture involves inserting thin, metallic disposable needles into certain points of the body.These needles are then turned by hand or stimulated by a machine.The aim is to restore the body's balance of qi, or 'life force' in Chinese.Ms Dora Ng, head acupuncturist of complementary integrative medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: 'Qi flows in the body to keep us going, and it must be kept in good balance.'If the energy flow is interrupted or becomes unbalanced, people fall ill, believe TCM doctors and practitioners.Ms Ng said that acupuncture can have any one of six effects:>>Pain relief through raising the level of endorphins, a painkiller released by the body;>>A feeling of sedation;>>Adjustment of the body's homeostasis - or the balance of opposing systems such as respiration rate and body temperature;>>Enhancement of the immune system;>>An anti-inflammatory result; or>>An anti-allergy effect.Acupuncture is useful when treating conditions such as muscular pains, joint pains, nerve pains and migraines, said Dr Yeo Sow Nam, a pain management specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital and the director of pain management services at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).Dr Cui Shu Li, senior principal acupuncturist at SGH, added that it is also effective against insomnia and anxiety.The World Health Organisation lists several conditions which can be treated by acupuncture, including rhinitis, headaches and facial palsy.However, there are many sceptics, too.In 2005, Germany's Technische Universitat released the results of a study which showed sham acupuncture to be just as effective as the real thing.In sham acupuncture, needles are inserted into patients' bodies, but not at the pressure points traditionally used to treat the condition involved. Researchers studied 302 migraine patients who either received acupuncture, sham acupuncture or no treatment at all.The result: 51 per cent of those in the acupuncture group had a 50 per cent drop in migraine frequency, while 53 per cent who received sham acupuncture reported the same effect.The study's authors speculated that the sham acupuncture appeared to have worked because of the placebo effect - the patients believed they would get better, so they did.They also suggested that putting needles into the body causes pain relief, regardless of where they are placed.But Dr Yeo Sow Nam, of Mt Elizabeth Hospital and SGH, said that acupuncture - practised in China since 2,500BC - has shown to be effective in many studies.Though he's a believer in the benefits of acupuncture, he backs 'multi-modal' treatment.For example, he might advise a patient with back pain to do stretching and strengthening exercises in addition to acupuncture.At the Hua Mei Acupuncture and TCM Centre, practitioners insist that patients follow the instructions of their Western physicians in addition to the treatment they provide.TCM traditionally uses treatments such as cupping and moxibustion as a complement to acupuncture when treating pain.Cupping involves placing heated cups of different sizes on the body.Moxibustion is a procedure where heat from a lighted medicinal stick is applied to needles inserted into the body.But acupuncture does have its limitations.It cannot correct deterioration in the body, but can only relieve the resulting symptoms, warned Ms Dora Ng.Dr Cui Shu Li also cautions not to undergo acupuncture when 'excessively fatigued, hungry or emotionally upset.'The choice of acupuncturist is also crucial.Dr Yeo cited the case of a patient who nearly died when an acupuncture needle was inserted into his lung.He advised patients who do not know how to pick an acupuncturist to consult their Western medicine general practitioner or the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.E-mail: shelaghm@sph.com.sg"
64,1065.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Acupuncture scoring points with hospital patients; Shift seen in attitude towards TCM, not only among Chinese patients but also in a good mix from non-Chinese backgrounds","There's nothing unusual about needles being used in hospitals, as anyone who has had an injection would know. However a different kind of needle treatment is getting the attention of hospital patients these days - acupuncture. The younger generation, in particular, seems increasingly open to opting for acupuncture therapy at hospital as a complement to conventional treatment, say hospital acupuncturists. This shift in attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practice is seen not only among Chinese patients but also in a good mix of patients from non-Chinese backgrounds, they add. Acupuncture services are offered at public hospitals like Tan Tock Seng Hospital and National University Hospital, as well as at private hospitals like Raffles Medical and private clinics like those run by Eu Yan Sang. Some places, such as Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution, give free TCM consultations.  In Singapore, TCM is carried out by TCM physicians accredited by the TCM Practitioners Board under the Ministry of Health (MOH). ""There is now a reversal, of acceptance of alternative or complementary treatment by the younger generation who are looking for a natural and safe treatment,"" said Dr Richard Tan, principal resident physician at Alexandra Hospital, which is operated by Sengkang Health.  What to expect during a hospital acupuncture session   In Singapore, acupuncture services can be found in public and private hospitals to complement conventional Western treatment. The Straits Times visited one such clinic run by Sengkang Health in Alexandra Hospital recently to observe how acupuncture is practised in a hospital setting. Dr Richard Tan, principal resident physician at Alexandra Hospital, is also a registered traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician. He said patients have to be assessed by their physician to see if acupuncture is suitable for them. Those who cannot sit still or have easily torn skin are examples of those who might not be suited for this treatment, he added. Each session, lasting between 20 and 30 minutes, begins with the patient describing his ailment. The physician will then determine the pain points to be needled, and the patient might be asked to lie down on a clinic bed or stay seated for the procedure,he said. Needles used are the same as the ones used in private acupuncture clinics. They are extremely fine, measuring from 0.12mm to 0.35mm in diameter - much smaller than injection needles, said Ms Tan Weii Zhu, TCM physician at Raffles Chinese Medicine. Needles usually go only a little beyond the surface of the skin. According to the British Acupuncture Council, practitioners are usually guided by the sense of contacting the energy of the patient, and this might be achieved at relatively superficial levels just beneath the skin. An infrared lamp is placed near the area of pain to allow heat to be conducted through the needles for enhanced circulation. A machine that produces a small electric voltage is also connected to crocodile clips attached to the acupuncture needles inserted in the skin. This sends a small electric current through the needles, which can restore health and well-being, according to TCM theories.Tan Shu Yan  Ms Melissa Ong, an acupuncturist at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), said around 40 per cent of the patients who seek acupuncture at the public hospital are non-Chinese and under 25 years old. Ailments treated in hospital using acupuncture are most often musculoskeletal in nature, such as neck, back and shoulder pains, said Dr Tan. Ms Tan Weii Zhu, a TCM physician at Raffles Chinese Medicine Tan said pain in the joints and muscles, fertility issues and stress-related conditions like insomnia and headaches are the most common conditions seen for acupuncture treatment at her clinic. ""The youngest acupuncture patient that I've encountered is six years old and the oldest is 94,"" she said. The six-year-old girl had muscular aches in the arms and legs after too much physical activity, she recalled. Despite an apprehension of needles, the therapy was relatively painless for the child, and she felt better afterwards, Ms Tan added.  The Singapore Government began regulating the TCM industry in 2000, when the TCM Practitioners Act was passed in Parliament. Under the act, all TCM practitioners have to be registered with the TCM Practitioners Board. The process began the following year (2001) - starting with the registration of acupuncturists. This was followed by TCM physicians in 2002. Today, there are 1,396 acupuncturists certified under the Board. In 2005, the MOH allowed licensed hospitals and nursing homes to have full service TCM clinics - including acupuncture, tuina and herbal medicine services - to be co-located on their premises. The TCM clinic must, however, be clearly distinct from the conventional medical services. So far, having acupuncture services in hospital has offered patients some benefits. It has, for instance, made it easier for TCM physicians to access the patient's medical background before performing acupuncture, and to speak to the doctor who treats the patient. The TCM physician can then peruse the patient's test results and ensure that he can safely receive acupuncture treatment. If the patient's health records reflect that he has an artificial heart valve or metal pacemaker, for instance, then he would not be considered for acupuncture because of the electrical currents that will pass through the needles. ""A physician practising acupuncture in hospital could have better communication with the patient's other healthcare providers in the same hospital, and at the same time have access to tests and radiological results,"" said Ms Ong. At Alexandra Hospital, the in-house acupuncture clinic can provide treatment in the wards, which is more convenient for patients, especially those who are bed-bound.                            The service is run by Dr Tan, who is trained in both Western and TCM, and has been practising acupuncture for 10 years. One theory behind how acupuncture works is the ""gate theory"", where the needles can stimulate a release of chemicals in the body that helps to reduce pain, said Dr Tan. He believes that TCM and Western medicine operate on fundamentally different principles. The former is more observation-based, and the latter is theory-based. And while there are tried and tested Western medication for specific conditions, individuals respond to these drugs differently. For example, a particular fever medication might work more effectively for some than others. Similarly, if someone has back pain, they might respond well to painkillers like paracetamol, while others might require an additional source of pain relief such as acupuncture, said Dr Tan. Therefore, each person should opt for the treatment that is most suitable for him, suggested Dr Tan. For 34-year-old M. Hanif, acupuncture was not on his mind when he was diagnosed temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder in January this year. The disorder causes tightness of his jaw muscles and affected daily functions like talking and eating. He was prescribed the usual painkillers, but the medicine did not help him much . Mr Hanif also knew full well the side effects of taking excessive medication - he works as a doctor at Sengkang Health. After finding out about Dr Tan's clinic, which had about 100 patient visits last year, he decided to give it a go. ""I felt acupuncture is generally quite safe if done properly, in the sense it's not something that you take internally,"" he said. At his fourth acupuncture session on April 10, Mr Hanif said he felt the treatment had enabled him to move his jaw with more ease. During the session, he had 13 needles inserted in various parts of his body, including his legs, wrists and behind the ears. ""Initially I thought that it might be very painful... It doesn't feel like a prick... (but) like an achy sensation,"" said Mr Hanif. Acupuncturist Ms Ong noted that the more significant sensation is not pain, but that of ""soreness, heaviness, numbness and sometimes a current like sensation"". ""These sensations are important as they indicate that the acupuncture points are being stimulated,"" she said. However, some TCM methods offered in private acupuncture clinics are not as commonly found in public hospitals. These include moxibustion (the burning of herbs near the skin), fire cupping, meridian scraping therapy and bloodletting. This is because hospitals are cautious about the risk of infection and skin bruising. In general, Dr Tan advised against going straight for acupuncture therapy - instead, the patient should get diagnosed and treated by a Western doctor first. Acupuncture can then come in as a complementary treatment, such as to relieve pain. ""Alternative medicine means it's either or - it is exclusive,"" said Dr Tan ""But acupuncture is complementary, which means we integrate TCM into conventional medicine."""

'As a physician, I didn't want to risk any side effects with Western medication with my baby,' the TCM practitioner said.Dr Diarra was born in the West African country of Mali but, for the past decade, has practised traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).The 40-year-old trained as a general practitioner and was sent to China for the first time in 1984 for further training. Once there, he found he wasn't learning anything new in Western medicine, and thought he could learn a lot more from Chinese medicine. He said of that time: 'I switched and went through my medical qualifications in Chinese medicine and then started working there.'The French-speaking Dr Diarra did not have problems studying at the Guangzhou University of TCM, as he had learnt Mandarin at the Beijing University of Language.He is so proficient in it that, in fact, he would lapse into Mandarin during our interview at the Spa Botanica on Sentosa, before translating what he said into English for my benefit.Integrating two or even three languages is something Dr Diarra does naturally, the same way he integrates Chinese and Western medicines.He explained: 'Studies we have done in stroke and other diseases are that if you put the two medicines together, you can get a better result and the quality of life of the patient improves.'The branch of Chinese medicine that blends effortlessly with Western is acupuncture. It involves inserting needles into certain points on the skin, called acupoints, along energy channels in the body known as meridians. These are connected with particular organs in the body. Dr Diarra said that there are 361 acupoints in the body, but at most times, only 72 of those are used.Most people know of someone who has been to the acupuncturist for help with weight loss or to give up smoking, but the World Health Organisation recognises 48 conditions that benefit from acupuncture. Those include stroke rehabilitation, menstrual pain, facial palsy, insomnia, rheumatic arthritis, urinary incontinence and menopause syndrome.Dr Diarra said that to make acupuncture work, the general population has to know more about its uses. For example, 'if you have menstrual pain, then to be rid of it completely, I recommend you come to me one week before your period'. A lot of women go to him only when the pain starts and although he can relieve it at that stage, why suffer the pain in the first place?That goes for many conditions, like headaches, back pain and digestive problems.When it comes to pain relief, the pain should lift within five minutes of the acupuncture treatment starting. Sometimes, it's immediate. 'Studies have been done in China, and in the United States, that show acupuncture can reduce the need for high doses of morphine, the strongest painkiller, by 53 per cent,' noted Dr Diarra.He is also keen to point out how acupuncture can aid in stroke recovery: 'Singapore has one of the highest stroke incidences in the world and if you combine acupuncture with Western medicine, it would help a great deal in rehabilitation.'Such is Dr Diarra's conviction, that as well as his own baby, he has also persuaded other parents to allow him to use acupuncture on their newborns for upper respiratory infections.His wife is also his patient. He used acupuncture to correct her myopia.It took one month of her keeping acupuncture needles in her ears, changing to a new set every three days.Dr Diarra has been in practice for many years, and says that, as doctors in training, they had to give each other acupuncture so that they knew how it felt.He advised: 'If you are having acupuncture done for the first time, you won't be able to tell if it is being done right, whether the needle is being put in the right place or not.'He says that if it's been done correctly, you shouldn't feel the needle once it's inserted.On insertion, you may feel a mild sensation, but that should pass quickly. The needles used vary in length and thickness and are usually made of stainless steel.The amount of needles inserted varies too, as not just the affected body part will be treated.Dr Diarra says the practice of acupuncture, now thousands of years old, has changed over the years because now people are realising that as well as treating pain and particular conditions, it can be used as a general balancing treatment for well-being.To find a registered acupuncturist, go to www.moh.gov.sg and click on 'Healthcare Professionals Search', and then 'TCM Practitioners'.Dr Diarra, unfortunately, can't oblige as he is now back in Yunnan training doctors in integrated medicine."

She added, however, that the question was how to raise its quality. She said that, although a number of recommendations had been made in the report by the Committee on Traditional Chinese Medicine last year, the ministry could not rush to implement them.It had first to build up its own expertise. Also the various TCM organisations had to come together to raise standards.She was replying to Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC) and Dr Wan Soon Bee (Brickworks GRC), who had urged the Government to act more quickly on this issue.On the other hand, Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah) wanted the ministry to adapt a more cautious approach.Dr Wong said that there was now a coordinating committee of TCM organisations which was looking into three main areas:- Improving training, including how to upgrade the present five-year part-time course into a six-year, part-time diploma course,- Listing the existing number of TCM practitioners. It was alsocarrying out a survey of members of its own and other organisationsto see what kind of training was needed.- Looking into questions of professional ethics, charges, the doctor-patient relationship and how to discipline errant members.She also stressed that TCM's role was to complement Western medicine, not to replace or to provide an alternative to it.Dr Wan had also suggested that the ministry allow suitably qualified TCM practitioners from other countries to practise in Singapore, arguing that it would help to raise the standard of TCM here.A Health Ministry spokesman told reporters that the ministry had already allowed graduates from six leading China universities to practise in non-profit organisations here if they wished.These universities were the Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Chengdu TCM universities, as well as the China Academy of TCM in Beijing.In the meantime, the ministry has also set up its own TCM unit to supervise and co-ordinate the implementation of the committee's recommendations.It also formed a unit which will list medicines, license products as well as the retailers, distributors, manufacturers, exporters and importers of Chinese proprietary medicines.

Yishun Polyclinic has treated more than 1,200 patients since the service was launched in October last year - and demand is growing. Four acupuncturists operate the clinic using only one consultation room and two beds. Plans have been drawn up for more rooms and beds.Most of the patients who go through this therapy for pain relief have joint and lower back problems. They are assessed and referred to the acupuncturists by a polyclinic doctor or general practitioner. Walk-ins are not accepted.The acupuncture service is meant to complement Western medicine, said Dr Angelia Chua, a senior family physician and certified medical acupuncturist, who started the programme.Patients get an 'East meets West' treatment: Alongside acupuncture, they are given Western remedies like painkillers.Almost half the patients are below 50. Many of the older patients are treated for knee pains, while the younger ones usually complain of migraine. They have been responding well to the treatment. Those who do not show improvements after treatment are referred back to their doctors.Dr Chua attended a TCM and acupuncture course in China under the sponsorship of a Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) award in 2006.The National Healthcare Group, which Yishun Polyclinic comes under, gave out HMDP awards to another 189 health-care workers on Wednesday.

APRIL CHONG reports,"Acupuncture is typically associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners.There is also acupressure, which one can easily try on oneself without acupuncture needles.It can be as simple as kneading one's shoulders or pressing a sore spot. Acupressure is based on the same principles as acupuncture. Both TCM branches have been practised for thousands of years. They work on relaxing muscles so that congested meridian points in the body are relieved and energy can flow, said Ms Dora Ng, the head acupuncturist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's (TTSH) complementary integrative medicine department.In acupressure, pressure is applied on acupoints along the meridian flow which are paths of energy within the body, MsNg said.Examples of acupoints include the back of the head below the first spinal bone and the shoulder midway between the neck and arm.It is easy to try acupressure on yourself when you are, say, watching television or when you need a quick pain fix.A common do-it-yourself method is to exert firm pressure on an acupoint using the fingers or palm. You can also clench the fists lightly and pound the spot rhythmically, said Ms Seah Ai Wei, a TCM physician at Thomson Chinese Medicine.You can even lie down or sit against a tennis or golf ball pressed against sore spots in the back or shoulder where the muscle is knotted, said Dr Kong Keng He, a senior consultant and head of complementary integrative medicine at TTSH.But not everyone should try accupressure on themselves.Pregnant women and the elderly who are weak or undergoing medical treatment and those with sensitive skin, fractures or severe osteoporosis should not try it, Ms Seah said.The gallery above showcases some common problems you can alleviate with do-it-yourself accupressure.aprilc@sph.com.sg"

Another - a device inserted in the ear that shoots electrical impulses into the brain - offers acupuncture on the go.Both treatments, meant mainly for people with chronic pain, are now offered by the Complementary Integrative Medicine Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). The clinic provides alternatives to Western medicine.Portable ear acupuncture is done by sticking an acupuncture needle into the ear, which contains many nerves.The needle is connected to a tiny battery-powered computer, which is taped behind the patient's ear. A small electrical current is sent down the needle at regular intervals over three to four days.As in traditional acupuncture, the needle and electricity stimulate the nerves into sending signals to the brain to release pain-numbing chemicals into the body.Studies in Austria, where the device was invented, have shown that it does as well as traditional acupuncture in providing relief for chronic back and neck pain.Dr Kong Keng He, who heads the TTSH clinic, said the device can reduce hospital trips for patients, many of whom usually need three sessions a week.He said: 'It's very inconvenient for working adults to come to hospital frequently.' The clinic has treated more than 10 patients since it started using the device in the past year or so.One of them, 65-year-old executive Ann Choo, woke up one morning in July 2006 with pain shooting down her lower back and right leg.Despite exercises, massages and three sessions of traditional acupuncture, the pain persisted. But after three days of using the device, the pain disappeared, she said.The clinic has started a trial on 15 patients to see how well the device works here and if the local climate causes any problems.In the last two years, TTSH has also treated patients in its satellite rehabilitation ward in Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital with 'needleless' acupuncture that uses a low-powered laser beam, instead of needles.The clinic plans to offer such laser acupuncture to the general public in two months.It is meant for young children and people who fear needles, or have heightened sensitivity to pain, Dr Kong said.One such patient, Ms Dorothy Teo, 59, suffers from lupus, a condition that sometimes makes her extremely sensitive to pain. But she needs acupuncture to ease her severe joint pains, also brought on by lupus.She said: 'When I'm hypersensitive, even opening my eyes is painful. So laser acupuncture is good.'With laser acupuncture, she needs to take just one painkiller daily, instead of three different types.Therapy using the ear device costs $120 to $150, while an acupuncture session, with or without laser, costs $50 to $70.huichieh@sph.com.sgMANAGING PAIN'I was almost incapacitated by the pain.

It is conducted in both English and Mandarin and will be continued today and tomorrow.One of the acupuncturists, Madam Nancy Wong, 24, a mother of a six-month-old baby, said her participation in the appraisal marked the first time she has left her baby's side.Madam Wong graduated from the University of Technology, Sydney with a bachelor's degree in health sciences (acupuncture) in 1999.She has been practising acupuncture for a year, but stopped temporarily after giving birth in November last year.Like Madam Wong, those who sat for the appraisal have some knowledge of acupuncture and were exempted from the basic qualifying exams, but they had to be tested for their practical knowledge.To ascertain the competence of such practitioners, the appraisal tested them in three areas: a written test on case analysis, and practical clinical assessments which assessed them on acupuncture techniques and the location of acupuncture points on the human body.When asked how she prepared for the appraisal, Madam Wong said, ""I studied the curriculum textbook every day for two weeks, three hours each day.""Others were not so well-prepared. Mr Sim Seow Khai, who is in his late 60s, said he had been too busy with home renovations to study for the exam.""I had no time to prepare. So I just had a positive attitude and did the best I could.""Even though she was well-prepared, Madam Wong was a bundle of nerves during her practical assessment. ""I was shaking. The three examiners were looking at my work. I don't know if I missed out anything in my answers,"" she said.Those who do not pass this appraisal will have another chance at it next month.After it was over, a tired Madam Wong said all she wanted was to go home and be with her baby girl -- and keep her fingers crossed that she had done well."

THE Singapore General Hospital plans to set up an acupuncture research facility, in another sign that traditional Chinese medicine is increasing its presence at hospitals here.Dr Charles Ng, chairman of the medical board at SGH, said the unit, when formed, would focus on research rather than provide regular clinic services, ""until such time, data is collected to prove that acupuncture has value"". Dr Lim Shih Hui, an SGH neurologist researching epilepsy, added that the aim was to find out whether a combination of Western and traditional Chinese medicine was better than either form alone.""The purpose is not to prove that one is better than the other,"" said Dr Lim, who is also a member of the research committee at the first acupuncture clinic at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital.The clinic has seen more than 450 patients since it opened last September.Over at Alexandra Hospital, deputy medical director Dr Chay Swee On confirmed it was preparing to set up Singapore's second acupuncture clinic, and was looking into the necessary administration.The Senior Minister of State for Health, Dr Aline Wong, announced this in Parliament last Friday during the Budget debate.Dr Chay said he hopes to see acupuncture become ""a useful adjunct"" to Western treatments such as physiotherapy and heat treatment.""We should keep an open mind and give it a chance,"" he said.At Tan Tock Seng Hospital, acupuncture has in fact been used for some time to treat pain but not cure illnesses. Dr William Chan, head of rehabilitative medicine there, said acupuncture has been used at the hospital's pain clinic.It is administered by an acupuncturist under strict medical supervision by a doctor, according to Health Ministry guidelines. Only 50 new cases are taken on each year.Dr Chan said studies had shown clearly that acupuncture works for benign types of pain, such as chronic muscle strain.Most studies from China, he noted, were not comparative but limited to specific cases. They also did not do enough to remove a patient's own bias towards the treatment, making it hard to measure the ""pure effect"" of acupuncture.There was no reason why Tan Tock Seng Hospital should not expand its use of acupuncture if there was a demand, he added. These and other moves would be consistent with Health Minister George Yeo's vision that the ideal approach was to integrate Chinese and Western medical practices.Meanwhile, there is a month-long queue for treatment at the Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital's acupuncture research clinic, said administrator T. K. Udairam. The clinic's two Chinese acupuncturists, Professor Zhao Changxin and Madam Cui Shuli, handle some 60 treatments a day. Only those suitable for research are accepted.Prof Lee Tat Leang, who chairs the eight-member research committee, said the strong interest was understandable, as the clinic was seen to have a ""Sisir stamp"" of quality.Patients could also see that, if anything went wrong, there was an avenue for complaint if they went to the clinic rather than to a Chinatown sinseh. Prof Lee, who is head of of the department of anaesthesia at the National University Hospital, reckoned that it would take at least five years for Chinese physicians here to be certified and the practice of traditional Chinese medicine regulated properly.Emphasising that his committee's research might not yield conclusive results, he said it would take at least two years to compile findings.He acknowledged that some doctors objected strongly to acupuncture, but noted that there was enough evidence to show that it had ""quite definite efficacy"" in treating chronic pain.Research projects being undertaken now will look at whether acupuncture can help smokers quit, whether it reduces epileptic seizures in patients, helps post-stroke patients recover some functions and how useful it is in the treatment of lower back pain and pain that results from osteo-arthritis, a degenerative joint disease.Such research, he said, focused on specific ailments and findings could not be extrapolated to be applied to other types of conditions.""It will take five to 10 years of devoted study to produce anything more definite,"" he said."

Always consult a practitioner. Send your questions to mailto:stlife@sph.com.sg","I experience severe back pain which is sometimes aggravated by walking. Can acupuncture help?Back pain usually originates from the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, bones, joints and other structures in the spine. The pain may be sudden and it can be chronic or intermittent. It can also be localised or radiate to other parts of the body and the intensity often ranges from dull to piercing and burning.Other symptoms include numbness and a tingling sensation in the affected area. If the condition persists after three days, seek medical attention immediately.Back pain is due to a deficiency in the functions of the liver and kidney, insufficient kidney 'yang', as well as liver and kidney 'yin'. Poor 'qi' and blood circulation and pathogenic factors such as wind, cold, heat and dampness are also responsible.Acupoints such as shenshu and weizhong from the bladder meridian of foot-taiyang are used to relieve back pain and strengthen the kidney's function, while weiyang is used to dispel wind and cold.Chinese medicine such as desertliving cistanche (roucongrong) and morinda root (bajitian) are prescribed to increase liver and kidney 'yang', while talc (huashi) and bamboo shavings (zhuru) are used to dispel dampness. Ground dragon (dilong) and black snake (wushaoshe) help dispel wind, while Chinese angelica (danggui) and hirsute shiny bugleweed herb (zelan) improve circulation of 'qi' and blood.In addition, milkvetch root (huangqi) and medicinal changium root (dangshen) assist in the production of 'qi' and blood.Processed rehmannia root (shudihuang), fleeceflower root (heshouwu), glossy privet fruit (nuzhenzi) and white peony root (baishao) help increase liver and kidney 'yin'.Avoid bad posture such as slouching. Sleep for at least eight hours daily to help the production of 'qi' and blood. This nourishes your muscles and joints, as well as strengthens your immune system. Keep warm because it improves blood circulation and prevents cold and dampness from affecting your back and joints.Information provided by Lim Lay Beng, a TCM physician at YS Healthcare TCM Clinic in The Adelphi."

Always consult a practitioner first. Please send your questions to stlife@sph.com.sg","Teo Cheng WeeWhat is acupuncture, what are its benefits and what ailments are best treated by it?Acupuncture is a technique in which thin needles are inserted into specific points on the body to treat illnesses.This helps modulate the flow of 'qi', or the body's life force. 'Qi' flows through the body via meridians or channels. If one's 'qi' is not flowing well or is blocked, it may result in pain or illness. By inserting these needles at specific acupoints located throughout the body, the acupuncturist helps to strengthen the flow of 'qi', or remove blockages in the meridians, thus allowing 'qi' to flow smoothly again.Although it looks painful, there is only a brief prick as the needle enters the skin. There may be numbness, aching, swelling or a tingling sensation. But even children have gone through it with little fuss.Generally, eight to 10 sessions are prescribed for patients. Each session lasts for about 20 minutes.Acupuncture is most effective in relieving pain from migraine, arthritis, sprains or pain in the joints.Another area where it has worked well is post-stroke management - to help stroke victims regain movement of their limbs. Success rates vary, depending on the severity of the victim's stroke.Acupuncture can also help problems like insomnia, menstrual cramps, gastric pain and weight loss.My husband and I have been unable to have a child for the last two years. Can TCM help us?In TCM, couples who have been sexually active for two years without using contraceptives are considered infertile.If they come to seek help for this, we will first ask the wife to see a gynaecologist to do a full medical examination, so as to find out the cause of infertility. The husband is also advised to do a check-up, to see if there are problems with his sperm.In reality though, quite often these couples who come to us have already done such check-ups and have tried other methods of conceiving.Once the couple comes back to us with the medical report, we will analyse it to see how we can help them.For example, while infertility could be due to reasons like ovulation problems, in TCM's holistic approach, we may trace these to other problems, such as stagnation of the 'qi' in the liver, or kidney 'qi' asthenia (weakness). Through TCM medication, we can then help the couples with these other problems.It is hard for us to say which herbs are suitable for this, as each case is different and thus the prescriptions can be really varied.Information provided by Mr How Sek Kwong, head of the acupuncture research group at Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution, which offers free medical treatment for all; and Dr Tan Siew Buoy, TCM physician and head of the infertility research group at the institution.

74,1075.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Acupuncture at the hospital; This traditional form of treatment is carving out a niche in mainstream Western medicine. Lee Hui Chieh visits hospitals to find out more.,"Eighty-one-year-old Low Chwee Neo is undergoing acupuncture to ease her back and knee pains, not in a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinic, but in a Western hospital - Raffles Hospital.And she was referred to the acupuncturist by her orthopaedic surgeon, no less.She said: 'I don't trust acupuncturists in other places, only those accepted by a hospital.' Yes, acupuncture is digging a niche in mainstream Western medicine.But how big a niche? Well, besides Raffles, two other hospitals here - National University Hospital (NUH) and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) - offer acupuncture in-house for pain management. Their doctors refer patients to the acupuncturist just like they refer them to other health-care professionals such as physiotherapists or medical social workers.An indication of acupuncture having gained more than a toe-hold in the hospitals:NUH's Acupuncture Clinic sees 80 to 90 new referred patients every month; Of the more than 1,000 patients treated at TTSH's Complementary Integrative Medicine Clinic every month, about half are referred, the other half, walk-ins; Over at Raffles' TCM centre, the three acupuncturists treat about 40 patients a day, about a third of which are referred by their doctors.A further indication of acupuncture's growing acceptance here: Some hospitals where doctors do not refer patients for the traditional needle therapy also have TCM clinics on site.Alexandra Hospital, Changi General Hospital and the Institute of Mental Health have TCM clinics on their premises, which take in walk-in patients.Even doctors recognise this ancient Chinese art enough to have gone for training and certification in it, so they can practise it on their patients.Two of the six acupuncturists at TTSH, and one of the four at NUH, are doctors.With acupuncture having been proven effective in clinical trials, rheumatologists have been referring their arthritic patients for treatment, as have orthopaedic surgeons for those with back pains, neurologists for those with migraines, and oncologists, their cancer patients, said Ms Dora Ng, a former nurse who is now TTSH's head acupuncturist.Some patients ask for referrals; some go for it because they are unwilling or have been deemed unsuitable for surgery or medication.Acupuncture is being used in tandem with Western medicine and treatments.For instance, orthopaedic surgeon Lim Lian Arn of Raffles Hospital refers a patient or two with non-specific muscular pains each week, but supplements acupuncture with physiotherapy and medication.Acupuncture has been around for thousands of years, he said, and has been shown to have 'more than a placebo effect'.Professor Lee Tat Leang, a senior consultant from NUH's Department of Anaesthesia and a trained acupuncturist, agrees. The hospital's Acupuncture Clinic has received 'positive feedback' from doctors who have referred their patients for treatment, he said.Though there is little to show that acupuncture is 'better' than other methods of treatment, evidence does show that it is effective for patients with certain conditions, said Dr Lau Tang Ching, a consultant rheumatologist at TTSH.'If patients don't want to take Western medicine, you still need to help them relieve pain,' he said.However, doctors have also seen the limitations of acupuncture: Dr Lim at Raffles Hospital, for one, said many of his patients show some improvement after treatment, but then hit a plateau, after which there is 'no complete resolution of pain'.The other limitation is that acupuncture involves at least a few sessions, which adds up to more inconvenience and cost for patients, compared to medication, said Dr Lau.But he recommends it anyway if patients ask for it or if medication has not worked.As doctors refer their patients to acupuncturists for pain management, the reverse is happening too, when serious underlying ailments are suspected.Raffles' TCM centre sends 10 to 15 patients to the hospital's doctors every month, said its manager and acupuncturist Seah Ai Wei.She cited an example of a walk-in patient who asked to be treated for diarrhoea, but ended up being referred to a doctor when the acupuncturist saw that it was no ordinary stomach upset.It turned out to be colon cancer.For 81-year-old Madam Low, acupuncture once a week for two years has eased the pain in her left knee and her back, and also enabled her to put off surgery on both.She had her right knee done four years ago, but does not want to go through another operation:'The doctor told me acupuncture is not a permanent cure, but I'm trying to postpone surgery for as long as possible. I'm not keen because of my age, and my first experience was quite traumatic. It's very painful when you are cut for surgery.'With acupuncture, she can now bend her left knee, and stand after lying down and walk to the toilet, when she couldn't before.She said: 'The pain is still there, but it's more bearable and I can tolerate it.'E-mail: huichieh@sph.com.sg"

She has seen a TCM physician and was prescribed medicine but there is no improvement. Can acupuncture or tui-na massage help her? Excessive perspiration, sweaty palms and feet are caused by a deficiency in the functions of the lung and liver, insufficient heart and kidney 'yin' and poor 'qi', and blood circulation. Excessive cold and/or heat in the digestive system and pathogenic factors such as heat, fire and dampness also play a part.One reason your daughter's prescription of Chinese medicine did not work could be the duration of treatment. It takes between two and three months to see an improvement when treating sweaty palms.Other reasons are diet, lifestyle and a wrong diagnosis. For the treatment to be effective, it is usually complemented with acupuncture and cupping therapy.Chinese medicine such as largehead atractylodes (baizhu), atractylodes rhizome (cangzhu), Indian bread (fuling), pinellia tuber (banxia) and talc (huashi) are prescribed to dispel dampness and strengthen the digestive system.Medicinal changium root (dangshen), milkvetch root (huangqi), white peony root (baishao) and processed rehmannia root (shudihuang) increase 'qi' and blood and strengthen the liver and kidney.Common anemarrhena rhizome (zhimu) and Chinese wolfberry root-bark (digupi) are used to dispel fire and heat, while oyster shell (muli) controls sweating and reduces liver fire.Acupuncture points such as hegu, fuliu, houxi and yinxi are used to reduce sweating and strengthen the digestive system and balance the body's 'yin' and 'yang'. Feishu and yuji are used to reduce lung heat, while zhigou, taichong and yanglingquan are used to dispel liver fire and dampness.Cupping therapy stimulates 'qi' and blood circulation and helps dispel the pathogenic factors.Your daughter should exercise regularly to strengthen her immune system and regulate her body temperature.

Under new Health Ministry rules, anyone practising acupuncture will need to be registered by Jan 1 next year. So far, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Board has received 1,595 applications for registration.  Nearly 960 were fully exempted from having to go for more classes and examinations, based on their qualifications and experience. But of these, 246 were granted provisional registration, which means that they can practise as registered members and in two to three years' time, will be assessed to see if they qualify for full registration. Another 21 per cent were granted partial exemptions. These practitioners would have to take either an exam or courses to beef up their knowledge before applying for the licence. About 7 per cent of applicants will have to sit for an examination to get their licence. Most of them would also have to attend an upgrading course. These courses and exams will be run throughout the year. The applications of the remaining 12 per cent are being considered. This is because they could be non-Singaporeans, or they may not be practising acupuncture in Singapore. The applications for those with previous court convictions or those who need to submit more information are also pending, but the results should be out in a few weeks. Said Dr Wong Kum Leng, the registrar of the TCM Board: 'This covers practically all of them. The response has been very good.' He explained that the courses and exams conducted this year would not be repeated next year, which would have a different national exam."
78,1079.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Acupuncture will not cure cataracts,"   A There is no good scientific evidence to support the use of acupuncture for treating eye diseases, be it cataract or age-related macular degeneration.   Age-related macular degeneration causes the macula - the centre of the retina - to deteriorate.   A cataract is formed when the usually clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy, blocking light from entering the eye and causing vision to become blurred over time.    Acupuncture will not eliminate a cataract or reduce the severity of the condition.   The only method to treat a cataract is through surgery.    Cataract surgery is now very advanced and is generally very safe and effective. Visual recovery is usually relatively fast.    Modern intraocular lenses may also help to reduce a person's need for spectacles.    So patients need not wait for the cataract to be very severe or the vision to be very bad before undergoing cataract surgery.    If your father's cataracts are troubling him, then he would probably benefit from cataract surgery. He should be assessed by an eye specialist.medical director of The Singapore Medical Group's The Eye & Cornea Transplant Centre and Premium Lasik Surgery Clinic"

Researchers tested a technique using eye drops and acupuncture to treat a common condition called ""dry eye"", which causes redness and inflammation around the eyes.  Some 150 dry eye patients aged 40 to 85 were split into three groups of 50: one group was given eye drops and acupuncture, one was given eye drops and herbal medicine, and one received eye drops alone. After eight 20-minute sessions of treatment over 30 days, the group which received eye drops and acupuncture recorded the biggest improvement, of 88 per cent. Acupuncture was applied to patients' legs, hands and face. Results were measured by a high-tech device with a camera and diagnostic instrument to observe the patients' corneas, as well as through interviews and questionnaires. No negative side effects were observed. The study was part of a three-year collaboration between the Singapore Eye Research Institute (Seri) and Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution (SCHMI). The project received almost $290,000 in funding from the Ministry of Health's (MOH) TCM Research Grant over three years. Optician Tan Hwa Moi, who participated in the tests, said: ""The needle feels like an ant bite and after that, I think it feels OK."" The study's principal investigator and principal clinician scientist at Seri, Associate Professor Louis Tong, said: ""Dry eye is very much a condition that stems from modern living. ""Most adults are prone to this due to poor dietary habits, lack of proper sleep and exercise, as well as prolonged computer use."" He added that it is impractical to treat all dry eye cases in hospitals, and there needs to be a ""community approach"" to manage the condition while alternative treatments should be considered. The study's principal collaborator, Dr Pat Lim, said: ""TCM ophthalmology was established more than a thousand years ago and we believe by integrating the strengths of Western and traditional Chinese medicine, we can develop the ultimate solution for serving our eye patients in the near future."" Mr Liew Siaw Foo, board chairman of SCHMI, added: ""We also hope that integrated medicine can be adopted as the new direction for healthcare services in Singapore, thereby providing patients with the most convenient and therapeutic advantages."" The future evaluation of the study will depend on the funding received. Currently, dry eye patients can undergo private treatment at institutions like SCHMI."

81,1082.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Pinning down acupuncture: It's a placebo,"THE Singapore Medical Association (SMA) desires that doctors here be permitted to refer patients to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners.If this suggestion is accepted by the Singapore Medical Council, I believe the practice of evidence-based medicine - and patient interests - will suffer a blow.Of late, some doctors seem to have embraced even disproven remedies. Take, for instance, a review of acupuncture research that appeared last July in the New England Journal of Medicine. This highly respected journal is one of the most widely read by doctors across specialities. In Acupuncture For Chronic Low Back Pain, the authors reviewed clinical trials done to assess if acupuncture actually helps in chronic low back pain. The most important meta-analysis available was a 2008 study involving 6,359 patients, which 'showed that real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments'.The authors then editorialised: 'There was nevertheless evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.'First, they admit that pooled clinical trials of the best sort show that real acupuncture does no better than sham acupuncture. This should mean that acupuncture does not work - full stop. But then they say that both sham and real acupuncture work as well as the other and thus is useful. Translation: Please use acupuncture as a placebo on your patients; just don't let them know it is a placebo.The authors trotted out the same conclusion after they reviewed an important German trial which also showed acupuncture to be merely a placebo.In any randomised and blinded clinical trial of any mode of treatment for any condition, the finding that the treatment is no better than a placebo always leads to one conclusion only: It is therapeutically useless. Acupuncture, it would seem, is excepted from this rule.A final study chosen for review was a 'pragmatic' trial that was bereft of any use because, as the authors said, 'neither providers nor patients were blinded to treatment. Therefore, a bias due to unblinding cannot be ruled out'. In fact, such a 'trial' is inherently biased.Then, as spinmeisters, the authors concluded with a flourish: 'Acupuncture... has not been established to be superior to sham acupuncture... However, (it) may be more effective than usual care, (so) it is not unreasonable to... incorporate acupuncture into... the management of chronic low back pain.'Balderdash!I should add that I am not criticising TCM per se. Only acupuncture, a facet of TCM, albeit its most dramatic, is being scrutinised here. Chinese herbology must be analysed on its own merits.Interestingly, although acupuncture may be TCM's poster boy today, the Chinese physician in days of yore would have looked askance at it. Instead, his practice and prestige were based upon his grasp of the Chinese pharmacopoeia.Acupuncture was left to the shamans and blood letters. After all, it was grounded, not in the knowledge of which herbs were best for what conditions, but astrology.In Giovanni Maciocia's 2005 book, The Foundations Of Chinese Medicine: A Comprehensive Text For Acupuncturists And Herbalists, there is a chart showing the astrological provenance of acupuncture. The chart shows how the 12 main acupuncture meridians and the 12 main body segments correspond to the 12 Houses of the Chinese zodiac.In Chinese cosmology, all life is animated by a numinous force called qi, the flow of which mirrors the sun's apparent 'movement' during the year through the ecliptic. (The ecliptic is the imaginary plane of the earth's orbit around the sun).Moreover, everything in the Chinese zodiac is mirrored on Earth and in Man. This was taught even in the earliest systematised TCM text, the Yellow Emperor's Canon Of Medicine, thus: 'Heaven is covered with constellations, Earth with waterways, and man with channels.'This 'as above, so below' doctrine means that if there is qi flowing around in the imaginary closed loop of the zodiac, there is qi flowing correspondingly in the body's closed loop of imaginary meridians as well.These meridians run from head to toe to form a network interlinking 361 points on the skin. But why are there 361 points? Since the earth takes three minutes under 24 hours to rotate 360 degrees on its axis, the sun appears to revolve through 361 degrees on the ecliptic every 24 hours. Hence 361 points. This factoid alone is sufficient to nail down the acupuncture-astrology linkage.Since qi flows around in a closed loop, needles can be inserted at one of these points far removed from your site of pain to rechannel qi. If done well, this supposedly can cure your spot of trouble.Note that not only is acupuncture astrological in origin but also the astrology is based on a model of the universe which has the earth at its centre. This geocentric model was an erroneous idea widely accepted before the Copernican revolution.Today, no one believes the earth is at the centre of the universe. But the ancient Chinese saw this geocentric principle organising all of nature as well. From its accompanying astrological system, acupuncture was birthed.So should doctors check the daily horoscopes of their patients?andyho@sph.com.sgInterestingly, although acupuncture may be TCM's poster boy today, the Chinese physician in days of yore would have looked askance at it.

It integrates traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with modern Western science. Magnetic radio waves from a micro generator moderated by a transmitter sends qi -or energy -to the acupoints of a patient, without contact with his or her body.Said Dr Teppone, 42: ""The effect is the same as poking a needle through the skin of the patient.""He presented the new acupuncture method yesterday at the start of the two-day Fifth International Congress of TCM and Acupuncture at the Hilton Hotel.Dr Avagyan, 55, told The Sunday Times that both he and Dr Teppone started developing the technique more than 10 years ago.The latest model of the machine, called the Artsakh device, was developed only two months ago in Britain, where both of them work.""We are ready to market the technology in a big way now,"" said Dr Teppone, who brought a set here to demonstrate.Costing between US$ 2,000 (S$ 3,400) and US$ 3,000 each, he said the machine is widely used in Russia and several Eastern European states. It has just been introduced to Britain and Germany, he added.Dr Avagyan said they are looking for Singapore partners to manufacture the machine and market it to China and other parts of Asia.The executive chairman of the congress, Chinese physician and acupuncturist T. T. Ang, said the electronic magnetic radiation method of acupuncture would be good for those who are afraid of needles and pain.More than 150 people from over 30 countries are attending the congress, which is organised by the Chinese Nature-cure Institute which promotes TCM, acupuncture, taiqi and qigong exercises in Singapore."

Others who are also fully exempt are those with degrees from recognised TCM universities in China, including:* China Academy of TCM, including the Beijing College of Acupunctureand Orthopaedics * Beijing University of TCM* Shanghai University of TCM * Nanjing University of TCM* Chengdu University of TCM, and * Guangzhou University of TCMOther mainland universities, and those in Hongkong and Taiwan, will also be considered. Locally-trained acupuncturists with five-year part-time diplomas obtained before July 1990 from approved TCM training schools are also exempted from the examinations.Others with less practising experience will be granted provisional registration. The rest will have to either undergo an appraisal process or pass the CAQE.These criteria are valid only until Jan 1, 2002. After that, only those with degrees from recognised institutes will be registered, and only those with valid practising certificates will be allowed to practise.Parliamentary Secretary (Health) Chan Soo Sen announced that a TCM Practitioners' Board will be set up by the middle of next year which will function like the Singapore Medical Council.It will regulate the TCM industry and its practitioners, conduct examinations, and run a nine-month Acupuncture Upgrading Training Course.Said Mr Chan: ""This is necessary to ensure public safety ... It will also raise ... standards and enhance its professional image.""The CAQE and upgrading course, to be administered by one of the local TCM schools, will be in Chinese. But Dr Wong Kum Leng, TCM director at MOH, said arrangements will be made for those not proficient in Chinese.He added that the board will discuss whether to recognise TCM degrees from countries like Germany, Australia and the US. MOH plans to register all TCM practitioners by 2002."
84,1085.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,A prickly issue; Those trained in acupuncture and Western medicine nail cause of conflict,"AT A specialist clinic in Paragon Medical, it is not unusual to see patients seated in the waiting area with needles poking various parts of their bodies.Ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon Tan Nam Guan is also an acupuncturist, and he administers this alternative medicine to his patients as a treatment option. 'I never promise that acupuncture will treat them 100 per cent, but that it may help.'Dr Tan is one of 97 doctors here who are certified acupuncturists, according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (TCMPB). Although 88 of these doctors hold valid practising certificates, it is not known how many of them actually use acupuncture as a form of treatment. Among the Western-trained doctor-acupuncturists are three licensed TCM physicians.TCM practitioners incorporate the use of herbal medicine and acupuncture to treat patients, while acupuncturists can practise only acupuncture. It takes a part-time course of seven years to be a TCM physician and a one-year part-time course to be an acupuncturist.In 2006, the Singapore College of TCM, a privately run institution, launched an English-language graduate diploma for Western-trained doctors keen to be acupuncturists. The part-time course attracted 49 doctors, all of whom graduated the following year. In 2008, 22 doctors took up the course and passed; the number dropped to 12 in 2009.The course teaches the theoretical and practical aspects of acupuncture and how to use it to manage diseases. Doctors have to complete clinical attachments and sit a test by the TCMPB.Acupuncture made the news earlier this month, when Straits Times senior writer Andy Ho wrote an opinion piece questioning the Singapore Medical Association's proposal to permit doctors here to refer patients to TCM practitioners. He cited a study that found real acupuncture treatments to be no more effective than sham ones, and said that acupuncture was based on astrology. A debate in the Forum page ensued, with physicians and patients from both camps speaking out.Dr Derrick Aw, a dermatologist who practises acupuncture at National University Hospital (NUH), commented that it may not achieve the gold standard of scientific evidence to be positioned as a first-line or efficacy-credible form of treatment.'But it remains a safe option for patients who seek complementary modalities of treatment for their chronic conditions,' he said.Those qualified in both Eastern and Western medicine point out a lack of understanding of TCM as the main cause of conflict.Dr Tan said: 'Previously, there was a high chance I would have said the same of TCM. But the training I received helped me to appreciate and understand acupuncture. I believe they may have a different perspective if they have undergone TCM training.'It is a view shared by Dr Swee Yong Peng, a general practitioner and a qualified TCM physician. Dr Swee, who teaches a compulsory two-day TCM module at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, said the subject may not interest all students, but it is nevertheless an 'eye-opener' for those who appreciate an explanation of another mode of treatment.Whatever their view, doctors cannot ignore how more patients are turning to acupuncture as a complementary treatment or for help on ailments that Western medicine has no answers for.One of them is private banker Charlie Bigard, 27, who suffers from sinusitis which leaves her with migraines and a perpetually blocked nose. 'Acupuncture alleviated my headaches while Western drugs helped clear the nose,' she said.Clinics like Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Complementary Integrative Medicine (CIM) centre have seen a 10 per cent year-on-year growth over the last three years. The clinic is manned by two doctors trained in acupuncture and five TCM physicians. Last year, it had 21,000 visits by patients, said its head Kong Keng He.These East-West physicians stressed the importance of acupuncture as a complement to Western medicine.'Acupuncture is seen as a complementary treatment at the CIM clinic. Most patients would have been evaluated by a medical doctor before seeking acupuncture treatment,' said Dr Kong, who is a doctor-cum-acupuncturist.Dr Tan emphasised that he uses his knowledge of Western medicine to diagnose patients, while acupuncture is meant to augment treatment.A Ministry of Health spokesman said doctors are free to study TCM to become qualified TCM physicians or acupuncturists, but the two fields are separate.Registered doctors can combine acupuncture with Western medicine, but combining TCM and Western medicine in the same clinic is not allowed as it would be 'misleading to patients'. The doctor would have to set up a separate TCM clinic to be regulated by the TCMPB.'Patients then make a conscious choice about whether they are coming for a Western doctor consultation or a TCM consultation,' said the spokesman.melpang@sph.com.sg"

'If you were to look at me today, you wouldn't believe that I had suffered a stroke a year ago,' she said.If this had happened 10 years ago, she probably wouldn't have got the referral. Madam Chionh would have had to seek the alternative treatment on her own.In 1994, there was little contact, let alone a formal arrangement, between Eastern and Western medical institutions. Traditional Chinese medicine was by and large practised in the shadows, well away from the scientific discipline called Western medicine. There was little acceptance of it by the mainstream medical community.As Dr Tommy Cheng, a professor in pharmacology at the Yale University School of Medicine in the United States, put it: 'When you dabble in Traditional Chinese Medicine, alternative medicine or other folk medicines for that matter, colleagues in the profession tend not to take you seriously. You are deemed as second class, someone who is backward in thinking and application.'Aside from popular perceptions that TCM belonged to an older, more superstitious time, the lack of regulation meant that trained doctors often had to clean up after poorly trained practitioners.According to a Ministry of Health (MOH) survey in 1994, Government and restructured hospitals in Singapore reported 154 cases of complications arising from TCM treatment between August 1994 and January 1995.These included improper treatment of fractures, allergic skin reactions, severe infection, bad treatment of diabetes, and hepatitis induced by medication.Around that time, moves began to be made to regulate the industry and also boost the standards of TCM practice. TCM physicians had to be qualified and registered with the MOH; a college was established to train them, and tougher rules were introduced for Chinese Proprietary Medicine.These required products to be labelled, and every consignment to be tested by an accredited laboratory.Ten years on, TCM is making real inroads into the mainstream Western medical community.While TCM has always been available to the public - in 1994, nearly one in two Singaporeans (45 per cent) turned to it at one time or another - it is only a few years ago that acupuncture began to be available for outpatients in one or two hospitals.The latest collaboration between AMKH and the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine takes contact to a new level.From next month, the hospital will have a full-fledged TCM medical centre on its premises, offering acupuncture, remedial massage (tui-na) and herbal cures.Recently, a breakthrough congress was held here which saw 500 professionals from both the Western and Eastern traditions coming together to share information on the latest research.Helping the resurgence of TCM was not just the internal moves made to improve the profession, but also external trends which saw traditional therapies being embraced, on the one hand, as promising cures were discovered among them; and on the other, as people became disillusioned with the shortcomings of Western medicine.Sure, TCM faced a setback in 2002 when actress Andrea de Cruz suffered liver failure and another woman died after taking Slim 10, a herbal slimming product that was contaminated with pharmaceuticals.But rising healthcare costs and recent high-profile controversies of Western drugs and their side effects - as in the four arthritis drugs, Vioxx, Bextra, Celebrex and Aleve, linked to heart troubles and strokes - have driven people to turn to alternatives.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration now considers acupuncture a viable alternative to conventional medicine.In June last year, it set out guidelines to manage the botanic drug industry which oversees the approval of herbs for therapeutic uses, including in conjunction with mainstream treatments.Professor Hui Ka Kit, director of the Center of East-West Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said: 'This resurgence of traditional medicines, of which traditional Chinese medicine is the most popular, is also indicative of America's increased interest in wellness and in more personal control of health.'Despite its ancient nature, TCM shows that it possesses essential features that compensate for the weaknesses of Western medicine.'In a nutshell, the holistic approach of traditional medicine, in contrast with modern medicine's focus on curing specific illnesses, is gaining favour with doctors and patients alike.The gift of Western medicine is to impose a rigorous scientific framework on researching herbs and compounds.This meticulous process allows active ingredients to be isolated and tested under conditions which will draw consistent results each time.Already, several prestigious medical institutions worldwide are conducting research on Chinese medicines and how it applies in the scientific arena.At the three-day inaugural International Congress on Complementary and Alternative Medicines last month, some 60 papers were presented, of which 34 were research on compounds which could be used in the treatment of a whole range of conditions, from cancer to heart disease.One of these was a substance, dubbed PHY906 by its Yale researchers, which was first described 1,800 years ago.The researchers first began studying if the substance, traditionally used to ease gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, could also relieve similar symptoms in people receiving chemotherapy for cancer.To their surprise, PHY906 not only helped deal with those side effects, but it also appeared to slow down tumour growth.Prof Cheng, who refused to divulge what the compound was, said: 'Preliminary results look encouraging and we want to further explore.'Another major clinical trial conducted in China found that red yeast rice, used extensively in Chinese cooking as food colouring for dishes such as Peking duck and char shao, cuts the risk of heart attacks in subjects with heart disease by more than half.The Chinese study involved about 5,000 patients, aged 18 to 75, from 65 hospitals all over the country.Because of the research, xuezhikang supplements have now been reformulated as an alternative to cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins.There is a Singapore connection.Wearnes Biotech Medicals, a Singapore company, provides the main raw materials that go into Hypocol, an off-the-counter dietary supplement, and Lipascor, a prescription drug, for sale outside China.In Singapore, too, research is being conducted on TCM herbs.Scientists from the National University of Singapore have found that the chrysanthemum flower used to brew tea contains an anti-oxidant which attacks cancer cells.The team, led by Assistant Professor Shen Han Ming, found that the anti-oxidant, luteolin, killed cancer cells in colon, breast and cervical cancers in the laboratory.It now intends to take the study further by conducting tests on animals.The scientific approach to researching Chinese cures has extended to the training of doctors.Increasingly, Western-trained doctors are taking adjunct qualifications in alternative medicines like TCM, though it would be much less common for crossovers to occur the other way.For TCM to be acceptable, it seems, it has to be built on a foundation of Western science.And so it will be at Ang Mo Kio, where patients will have to be referred by Western-trained doctors to their TCM colleagues if they think they will benefit from those alternative treatments.This is a model which Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan thinks can be exported to other hospitals, even the larger acute hospitals, if it takes off at the community hospital.Mr Khaw prefers not to call this an integration of Chinese and Western medicine. Rather, he says, they should co-exist, each with its own role to play.Even in China, which has 95 per cent of the world's integrated care hospitals, according to the World Health Organisation, TCM is used mainly as an adjunct.Said research professor Xu Ling from the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine: 'Most commonly, Chinese therapies are prescribed to patients wanting to reduce side effects and pain associated with their Western treatment.'It is greatly in demand though; nine out of 10 of her patients ask for integrated care, she says.That was what Ms Zhai Yujuan received at the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.She was suffering from Guillain-Barre syndrome, an inflammation of the peripheral nerves which causes fatigue, loss of sensation, inability to control muscles.When three months of Western medicine at the Peking University Third Hospital failed to improve her bed-ridden state, a desperate Ms Zhai opted for the alternative and was transferred to the Beijing facility.There she was able to continue her Western treatment, as well add Chinese massage, acupuncture and herbs to her prescription.Mr Karlo Berger, founder of Integrative Medical Alliance in the US, says such integration 'enhances the ability for caregivers of different backgrounds to communicate and coordinate their care for a patient under their joint care'.Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of Western medical educational institutions and hospitals in the US have been including the use of TCM - specifically acupuncture - in their curriculum and treatment modalities.The challenge is to increase the Western content of TCM curricula so that TCM practitioners can participate more fully in a healthcare system in which both are offered.Said Mr Khaw: 'To achieve a harmonious situation between Western-trained and Eastern-trained doctors, there has to be better understanding between the two.'Such understanding helps develop mutual respect.'And mutual respect leads to better care. Whether one calls it integration or co-existence, this embracing of TCM and other alternative therapies by Western medical science is likely to gain new ground.As scientific papers were read at the congress, a roundtable gathered to thrash out issues of regulatory control, intellectual property rights and commercialisation of TCM.Summing up, Prof Cheng said: 'A new paradigm is emerging. While previously Western-trained doctors thought nothing of TCM, today, I believe TCM is going to be part of mainstream medicine in the treatment of complicated diseases such as diabetes, cancer and degenerative illnesses. Chinese medicine and herbs can indeed provide the key information to the development of future medicine.' -- Additional reporting by Vanessa Mulquiney"

The condition is aggravated when I am under stress. Western doctors whom I have consulted told me this is a common problem, and that I should reduce my caffeine intake. Can acupuncture and Chinese medicine help? Eye twitching, medically known as blepharaspasm, refers to any abnormal contraction or twitch of the eyelid. It is a neurological disorder involving involuntary and sustained contractions of the muscles around the eyes.Without treatment, symptoms sometimes last for a few days, then disappear. However, in most cases, the twitching is chronic and persistent.The condition is due to insufficient 'yin' of the liver and kidney, a deficiency in the function of the spleen and stomach, excessive liver yang and weak 'qi' and blood circulation. Pathogenic factors such as heat, dampness and wind also play a part.Acupuncture, tui-na massage and cupping therapy can improve your condition by strengthening your organs and dispelling the pathogenic factors.Chinese medicine such as Chinese angelica (danggui), processed rehmannia root (shudihuang) and white peony root (baishao) are prescribed to strengthen the liver and kidney as well as increase production of blood.Incised notoptergium rhizome or root (qianghuo), divaricate saposhnikvia root (fangfeng), peppermint (bohe), stiff silkworm (jiangcan), gambir plant (gouteng) and tall gastrodia tuber (tianma) dispel dampness and wind as well as reduce twitching.In addition, milkvetch root (huangqi), Indian bread (fuling) and largehead atractylodes rhizome (baizhu) are used to strengthen the spleen and stomach and increase 'qi'.Avoid caffeine and irritants such as bright light that may trigger the twitching. Wear sunglasses if you are sensitive to sunlight. Lightly massaging the area around your eyes can also enhance blood circulation.Information provided by Ms Lim Lay Beng, a TCM physician at YS Healthcare TCM Clinic in The Adelphi."

Ms Kwek also teaches TCM at the National University of Singapore's Office for Continuing Education.To come to a diagnosis, the Chinese physician relies on four main techniques, she says.They are wang (to observe), wen (to listen and smell), wen (to question) and qie (to read the pulse).The internal systems of the body are carved up into five broad groups:<solbox> The heart system, which includes the ""thinking"" part of the brain (si xiang), blood vessels, small intestine and tongue.<solbox> The kidney system, which includes the analytical part of the brain, reproductive system, bones and joints, bladder and ear.<solbox> The lung system, which embraces the skin, big intestines and nose.<solbox> The spleen system, which includes the stomach, muscular system, hands, feet and lips.<solbox> The liver system, which has the gall-bladder, ligaments, eyes, emotional part of the brain (qing xu) and fingernails in its fold.All the systems in the body are inter-related, and influence one another, says Ms Kwek.""If there is something wrong with your intestines, the problem can come out as an itchy skin or insomnia,"" she says.External factors, such as climate and your working environment, also play a role.Those living in cold climates, or who work in an air-conditioned room, may suffer from dry skin and throat, and acute pain in the joints.A warmer, and more humid environment, however, may give rise to more complaints of sore throat and swollen joints, which feel more hot and heavy than painful.A job that requires you to talk a lot may explain your dry throat and hoarse voice. A highly-stressful job may cause you to feel tired and make you unable to sleep well.On top of these internal and external factors, the physician also has to keep in mind the peculiarity of each person's body.""No one body is similar to another,"" explains Ms Kwek.One of the most common concepts used to explain this difference is the famous yin-yang concept.""Everything has two opposing sides to it, so does the human body,"" she says.Thus, you have the ""hot"" type of flu (what is called fong re), and the ""cold"" version.In ""hot"" flu, you get sore throat and your phlegm is yellow and thick.The body feels more hot than cold, your tongue is reddish and the pulse beats faster than normal.In ""cold"" flu, however, your throat is only a bit scratchy, and your phlegm, colourless and watery.The body feels more cold than hot, the tongue looks normal and the pulse is slower than usual.The joints are also more likely to ache.The list of different types of flu runs on.Says Ms Kwek: ""Under the ""hot' flu, you also have the ""moist' and ""dry' types. There are at least four other different types.""The human body is a very complicated organism."" <solbox> If you have any questions on this topic, please e-mail them to stlife@sph.com.sg.

Encouraged by his Dad, he began to read books on the topics. And although he later enrolled in cooking school in Switzerland, he never lost interest in them.Now, 28 years later, the Swiss Culinary Academy graduate is fusing TCM with his French culinary skills.The 44-year-old heads the kitchen at Red White & Pure, a new $5-million spa, shop and restaurant outlet in VivoCity mall. It is run by the Eu Yan Sang group, which deals in health-care and TCM products.The chef, who worked in Thailand before coming here, gives interesting twists to familiar dishes like Chicken Cordon Bleu ($20.50++), usually a boneless, breaded chicken breast stuffed with ham and Swiss cheese.His version is stuffed with blue cheese, dates and wolfberries. More commonly known by the Chinese name gou qi, wolfberries is said to improve eyesight. Red dates, often used in Korean and Chinese medicine, are believed to alleviate stress.For dessert, there is Birds' Nest Ice-cream ($10.50++), a delicate treat which is said to improve the complexion.Chef Gamon describes the experimental process of coming up with the recipes as 'more error than trial', and says that the menu took about six months to finalise, with help from consultant herbalist Lee Jok-Theng.The chef, a bachelor, says he often cooks for his friends and always incorporates Chinese medicinal herbs in his dishes.'Cooking is a lifestyle, and I treat my TCM ingredients with great respect,' he says.It is the kind of vibe Eu Yan Sang wants to create in the 10,300sqft store, which is spread over two levels.Aside from the spa, which offers massages and acupuncture, there is also a shop that sells TCM products like American Ginseng, a 17m-long bar serving beverages such as tonics spiked with ginseng and ginkgo biloba, a terrace for drinking wellness teas and a 68-seater restaurant.The sleek decor, with clean white walls and walnut-wood furniture, is quite different from the group's more traditional TCM stores.As Mr Richard Eu, the group's chief executive, puts it: 'It's not just another medical hall.'He says the aim is to help people relax and counter stress and environmental pollution in an urbane setting.'We're bringing TCM's philosophy about balance to people in a language they can understand.'Red White & Pure is located at 02-141 VivoCity.

Always consult a practitioner first. Please send your questions to stlife@sph.com.sgSome hair treatment centres say they use Chinese herbs to cure hair loss. Is there truth to it? Can TCM help with male-pattern hair loss?We don't know what herbs the centres use to treat hair loss, so we cannot comment on the effectiveness of their treatments.There are several herbs that can be prescribed for hair loss, but the most common one is the fleeceflower root (heshouwu).Acupuncture can also be helpful in treating hair loss, by stimulating blood circulation to the head.Furthermore, as hair loss can be a result of a weak body - one that is too 'heaty' or too 'cool', or has poor blood circulation - it can be helpful to change your lifestyle to avoid activities that weaken your body.Bad lifestyle habits include smoking, drinking or staying up late.But having said that, hair loss often comes with ageing and it is unrealistic to expect to get back your lush crown of hair with treatment.It is probably more realistic to expect treatment to reduce hair loss rather than stimulate hair growth.Is it true that TCM has fewer side effects than Western drugs?Practitioners believe so.One important factor is that TCM uses natural herbs while Western drugs use chemicals. As herbs are natural, they are better processed by the body and give fewer side effects.The use of herbs is one that is well-researched and studied in TCM. It is one of the fundamentals of TCM and it is crucial for physicians to know the different uses of herbs and how they interact with one another.This allows us to use the different herbs to 'play off' one another. Some herbs, for example, may be poisonous on their own, but when combined with other herbs, they 'neutralise' each other.Others enhance the effect of one another. For example, in treating 'heatiness', the gypsum (shigao) has a quick but short-lived 'cooling' effect while the common anemarrhena rhizome (zhimu) has a slow but longer-lasting effect. We can thus combine the two for the best effect.Furthermore, in TCM, we have to examine and determine each person's inherent body composition to decide which herbs work best for him.What's good for one person may not be for another. That is somewhat different from a Western approach, where one drug is used for everyone, like paracetemol.All these contribute to TCM having fewer side effects, compared to Western medicines.Information provided by Ms Lim Nai Siang, TCM physician and secretary of the research department at the Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution.

There are more men who seek treatment, about 200 a month, compared to the 50 or so women. And foreigners are generally less suspicious and less cynical than locals about the treatments, said Dr Tan Kian Seng, head of the male fertility clinic at Chung Hwa Free Clinic.All his patients suffer from low or no sperm count and almost all have tried Western remedies -- from popping pills to participating in programmes at hospitals.Dr Tan pinpointed stress as a rising cause of impotence, especially among his younger clients.Before his patients start on a programme with Chung Hwa, they have to undergo a series of tests to determine the quality of their sperm.The clinic uses a combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which are prescribed individually.They also have to consume 10 kinds of herbs, many of which are imported from China, twice daily.It takes six to 10 months to get results. So after six months, patients have their sperm count examined again.The fertility clinic opened in 1994 and has extremely restricted hours, opening only on Saturdays between 7 pm and 9 pm in the evening.Every week the clinic gets 40 to 50 patients, mostly Chinese but occasionally Malay or Indian. Once, Dr Tan had an Israeli patient who heard of the clinic from his colleagues.Once their wives get pregnant, the patients obviously do not come back, said Dr Tan. So the clinic has no way of knowing how many couples have succeeded in having babies.Staff at the Thong Chai Medical Institution have a better idea of how their fertility treatments for women are going -- there have been 560 babies born under their programme so far.Dr Tan Siew Buoy, who has been with the clinic since it started in 1986, said most of her patients, including those from Australia and Japan, heard about the clinic through friends.The four practitioners at the clinic check patients according to the rules of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); everything from a person's breath, skin colour and even voice can tell them about her state of health.Women are required to drink a concoction of about 10 herbs four times a day and they return once a week to the clinic for a check-up. On average, it takes patients five months to a year and a half to conceive.Dr Tan Siew Buoy says that poor blood circulation, weight problems and kidney problems are common reasons for infertility in women.The average age for women who come to the clinic is 33.Both doctors said that patients using TCM do not suffer from any side effects; there are no food restrictions and it is not dangerous. In fact, both agreed that the herbs have unexpected benefits, such as making a person stronger or giving them a better complexion.Dr Tan Kian Seng pointed out that while in-vitro fertilisation can cost thousands of dollars, the cost at the free clinic is only $2.

But during the treatment to improve blood flow - known as moxibustion - both Mr Koh and his assistant left the room to attend to another matter, and ashes from the herb dropped on the patient's calf, causing the burns in May 2017.

After an investigation and hearing, the board concluded that Mr Koh had failed to exercise responsibility and appropriate care, take adequate precautions when administering the therapy and take adequate steps to prevent the burns. It also found that his moxibustion procedure was not one of the appropriate and generally accepted methods of TCM treatment, while his management of the patient's care amounted to professional negligence. The board noted that he showed remorse for his conduct and was a first-time offender. Mr Koh, who works at the Specialist Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre, must also pay the inquiry's costs. ""Based on the findings... the mishap could have been avoided had adequate care and safeguards been put in place,"" said the board, urging all registered practitioners to regularly review their practices to minimise the risk of burn incidents.

They were not based on astrology or the Zodiac.Visiting any doctor or fortune teller could be a form of placebo too and it is not fair to label TCM as a sham, bearing in mind it has been around for hundreds of years.Ling Liwei"
98,1099.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Objectivity must underscore medical treatment,"I AGREE with Mr See Yi Xiang's letter on Wednesday that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine are based on different philosophies (""Determining the efficacy of acupuncture""), but that does not negate the value of clinical trials in determining the former's efficacy. The primary aim of a clinical trial is to determine whether a particular treatment really works. It achieves this by striving to establish an environment in which potential biases and errors are controlled to ensure that any effect is attributable to the treatment alone. It is designed so that the results are not skewed by chance and error, as prevalent in anecdotal evidence.Clinical trials do not ""justify"" a particular philosophical system, but aim to find out the truth about a treatment. In fact, the history of evidence-based medicine is peppered with unexpected results from trials - where the results have turned traditional wisdom on its head.In the case of acupuncture, multiple well-designed trials have been run to determine its efficacy in different conditions. In most trials, acupuncture was delivered by certified practitioners treating patients as they normally would. Despite this, acupuncture has not been shown to consistently deliver benefits above that of placebo for the treatment of chronic lower back pain.This result has nothing to do with the underlying philosophy of acupuncture, but is merely a statement that in the treatment of lower back pain, acupuncture performed by a certified practitioner does not consistently provide any benefit over a placebo.As health practitioners, it is crucial to deal with this result in an appropriate manner. If we know full well that a treatment does not confer any benefit, can we ethically recommend it to our patients, thus bringing burdens of cost upon them, and exposing them to the risks of the treatment, such as pain and infection?Dr Tan Sing Chee"

He is able to move his limbs slightly and can recognise us. Can acupuncture help him and, if so, at which stage? A stroke is the rapid loss of brain function due to a lack of blood flow caused by blockage or leakage of blood. This leads to an inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body. The condition may also cause an inability to understand and formulate speech or impair one's vision.Besides acupuncture, your father should take small meals with no more than 4g of salt daily. He should also take less sugar but more vegetables and fruit.Acupuncture is commonly used to treat conditions caused by stroke, such as paralysis, speech impairment, swallowing problems and depression. Acupoints such as jinjin, yuye and tianzhu are used to treat loss of speech by enhancing the tongue's movement, while fengchi, jiquan, chize and hegu are used to treat muscle weakness, numbness and mobility of the hands.Acupoints such as weizhong and sanyinjiao are used to improve muscle strength and mobility of the legs, as well as alleviate numbness.Head acupoints such as baihui, sishencong and fengchi are used to enhance blood flow to the brain and speed up recovery. They also help in slowing down loss of memory, as well as enhance one's motor function.TCM treatment should start as soon as possible as the first three months after getting a stroke is an important period in assessing whether there is a possibility of improving motor skills such as walking.Your father should avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee and tea, as well as eating spicy food to prevent further clotting of blood, which could lead to another stroke.Information provided by Ms Lim Lay Beng, a TCM physician at YS Healthcare TCM Clinic in The Adelphi."

She suffers from dementia, and her condition has deteriorated recently, resulting in the need for her to pay regular visits to the clinic for acupuncture treatment.  However, the lengthy waiting times have brought about much stress due to her unstable mental condition. She is prone to creating a ruckus during the wait, or may even change her mind and decide to refuse treatment while waiting. This is rather problematic, as it means that she would not be able to reliably receive the treatment she requires, a potentially serious problem. I strongly suggest the establishment of priority queues for those who have immense trouble waiting for extended periods of time. These would include patients with severe dementia or debilitating mental or physical conditions which cause them to be incapable of enduring long waits. I strongly suggest applying such an initiative broadly to all healthcare institutions, including clinics and hospitals, in particular those serving the aged. With Singapore's rapidly greying population, there would be progressively more patients who suffer from severe dementia. As part of the country's move to make healthcare more accessible to the community, it is necessary to introduce priority to those who need it.Jenny Tan Lay Yong (Madam)"

In his written judgment, released last week, the judge also sent a warning to other TCM applicants: Stick to documentation procedures or face disciplinary sanctions.'Much depends on the actions of the applicants themselves - in particular, their commitment towards the practice of TCM as a calling and not merely as a business,' he said.Mr Tang applied to be registered as an acupuncturist in March 2001, claiming he was a full-time TCM physician at the ECM Chinese Medical Centre.He also submitted a certificate of employment, signed by a Justice of the Peace (JP) and purportedly co-signed by the clinic's owner, Dr Tan Kia Choo.Dr Tan complained to the board, which convened an investigation committee. It found that Mr Tang could not have been practising full-time as he was working as a manager at the clinic.Mr Tang argued that while he was doing administration work, he was simultaneously on standby. He also alleged that three members of the committee were biased.The committee recommended his registration be cancelled. This would have meant he would have had to wait at least three years before he could apply again.However, the board found him guilty of improper conduct and suspended him for two years instead.The judicial commissioner noted the forged signature had no legal effect on the authenticity of the document and was, in fact, redundant as a JP had already signed it. But he found Mr Tang responsible for the forgery.He said there was no basis for the allegations of bias.He also noted that it was imperative that the framework of TCM practice be observed 'scrupulously' to maintain and enhance the standards necessary for the development of the industry, as well as the interests of patients.He also had some advice for Mr Tang. 'If the appellant is truly committed to the practice of TCM, he should persevere. And that entails looking with hope ahead rather than lamenting about what ought to be left behind,' he said.Mr Tang has since left the clinic and now runs a health-screening business. He said: 'I won't leave this industry because this is my passion.'The board's lawyers, Rajah & Tann, said the ruling was an important decision that recognises TCM as an important part of medical services in Singapore.'This is also the way towards gaining public confidence in the practice of TCM,' they said in a statement."
102,1103.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Call for more research in traditional medicine,"  SINGAPORE is lagging behind other countries when it comes to research into traditional Chinese medicine, said Minister of State for Health Amy Khor yesterday.    She said countries such as the United States and Australia are conducting studies in related fields, including acupuncture, despite their shorter history of using Chinese remedies.     'We should be open to conducting more research in traditional Chinese medicine treatment,' she told a symposium at Nanyang Technological University.    She said this is an important way to gain public confidence in traditional therapies, and will help consumers to make informed choices.    Professor Hong Hai, a professorial fellow and traditional Chinese medicine physician at the university, said the lag in research is due to inadequate funding.    'We have people who are able to do it,' he said. 'I think some encouragement and better funding could result in better quality research and more research being done.'    The symposium was attended by more than 120 people, including industry players and allied health-care professionals.    Dr Khor also lauded the community for making an effort to keep its skills and knowledge up to date.   For example, organisations such as the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Eu Yan Sang have been holding regular courses and workshops to enhance standards in the industry.    Nanyang Technological University students get a foot in the door through internships at hospitals.   Six in 10 of the pioneer batch of 58 graduates from its double-degree programme in Chinese medicine and biomedical science have secured jobs in industries related to traditional healing. The rest opted to continue their studies or join other professions such as teaching.    Student Teo Chun Huat, 24, said: 'We are worried about finding jobs as the market is saturated but, with more external collaborations and research, I think more options will be open to us.' "

But they are actually waiting their turn at Yu Guo Chinese Physician Acupuncture and Physiotherapy, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinic offering tui na or Chinese therapeutic massage.  As soon as the clinic opens for its evening session at 6.30pm, its seven massage beds fill up. Many of the patients are babies and toddlers receiving tui na or Chinese therapeutic massage for conditions such as coughs and colds, or colic. Although much of TCM has yet to be scientifically proven, more parents are turning to it, especially in cases for which Western medicine has no treatment, like colic, or if they think their children are not getting better after seeing a general practitioner. Yu Guo and Herbal-Basic TCM Clinic are two clinics mentioned often in online forums such as KiasuParents and SingaporeMotherhood. Set up in 1986, Yu Guo sees an average of 100 children every weekday, an increase of 15 to 20 per cent from five years ago. On Sunday mornings, it is open for just 31/2 hours, during which time it sees about 90 young patients. Herbal-Basic TCM Clinic was set up in 2010 for adults and children, but switched to become a TCM paediatric clinic in 2011. At the time, it had about 100 child patients a week. Now it has 300. Other TCM centres such as Eu Yan Sang and Econ Chinese Medicine are also reporting an increase in young patients. Ms Koh Yan Yock, a physician at Yu Guo, said the clinic also offers acupuncture and prescribes medication if it is needed. Tui na is particularly popular among parents of infants and toddlers as it is non-invasive. She said: ""Parents have become more educated on its benefits. Some prefer this as it does not involve medication or injections."" Tui na, which literally means ""push and grasp"", aims to establish a more harmonious flow of qi (energy) through massage and hand manipulation techniques applied on various pressure points of the body. This is expected to allow the body to heal itself naturally. Mr Benjamin Tan, director of Herbal-Basic TCM Clinic, said parents often seek help for colic, a condition in which a baby cries a lot usually at night, for unknown reasons, and common ailments like cough. Fees for a tui na session typically range from $25 to $45. Parents told The Sunday Times they see TCM as a complement to rather than a replacement for Western medicine. Housewife Janet Ting took her three-year-old son for tui na when he was just two months old, when she was desperate to find something that would help his colic. She said he began to sleep better after a few sessions. ""I don't want my child to take too much medicine. But for peace of mind, I still take him to Western doctors. TCM is more of a supplement,"" said the 37-year-old. Likewise, sushi chef Edwin Lim, 43, who took his son Clarence, 10, for tui na on Thursday to treat a cough, still goes to Western doctors, though he said the tui na was also effective. Clarence, with one hand being massaged and another holding a piece of homework, said: ""The tui na is quite comfortable, and not that ticklish."" goyshiyi@sph.com.sg"

But talks with the Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Coordinating Committee (STCMOCC) -the umbrella organisation for TCM associations -have continued to be conducted in Mandarin, much to the chagrin of ethnic minority practitioners.The proposed examinations are part of a wider plan to register all acupuncturists here and regulate TCM.Of the estimated 1,807 TCM practitioners here, only about 10 are non-Chinese. But such practitioners say the ministry should have an English test despite the small number.Mr Sundardas Annamalay, 36, who has been practising for 13 years, said that acupuncture is not considered a science here, unlike in countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany and Australia.He said: ""If we want to be on par with Western medicine, it has to be treated as a science and not a culture.""He pointed out that even acupuncture research centres in China offered tests in English and Chinese.The proposed tests, he added, would not affect the existing crop of ethnic minority practitioners as they had already passed similar tests, some of which were held in Chinese.""If the test were to be carried out in Chinese only, then future generations of English-speaking practitioners will suffer,"" he said.An English test would also ensure that acupuncture does not die out with the current generation of physicians, said acupuncturist John Yeo, 43.He said that a Chinese-only test will discourage English-speaking people from learning and seeking acupuncture treatment.He said: ""For acupuncture to remain relevant, the ability of physicians to communicate in English is very important, as more patients are speaking English.""If it is limited to the Chinese-speaking practitioners, everybody will lose out."""

The third finger of my right hand cannot be straightened. My doctor says this can only be cured by operating on the hand as injections have proven ineffective. Can acupuncture treat this condition? How many sessions are needed? Trigger finger is the locking of a finger in a bent position, caused by a constriction of the sheath that surrounds the tendon.It's usually caused by the inflammation of the thin lining along the sheath, which can be the result of repeated movements.Acupuncture can help with this condition by reducing the swelling of the sheath, but its effectiveness will depend on when you seek treatment.It's better to do so as soon as possible. In that case, five to six sessions could be enough to regain movement in the finger.If you come more than six months after the condition has occured, you may need more sessions.However, if there is no improvement after two months, surgery may be the only option.Research has recently shown that chrysanthemum helps to prevent cancer. What other herbs and plants have anti-cancer properties?There are many Chinese herbs with anti-cancer properties. They can work in several ways: increasing your body's resistance, getting rid of the body's heatiness and toxins and improving blood circulation.Chrysanthemum can help clear heatiness and toxins in the body.Another common plant with anti-cancer properties is barley, which has been shown to reduce the size of tumours.Glossy ganoderma (lingzhi) and Indian bread (fuling) are also well known in this aspect.It's believed that consuming white carrot (bai luobo in Mandarin) cleanses the body of toxins. It's also said that consuming it neutralises any medication one is taking. Is there any truth to these beliefs?Yes, white carrot can cleanse the body of toxins. It helps with digestion by ridding the large intestine of toxins and is said to have anti-cancer properties.It also improves the flow of one's 'qi', dissolves phlegm and can cure coughs. If your mouth is dry, drinking blended white carrot juice can help.As for neutralising medication, it's true to some extent.Due to the cooling property of white carrot, it may not be suitable for those with a weak or 'cool' body constitution.If their intestines are weak, they can get diarrhoea if they take too much white carrot.As such, those who're weak and taking herbs to strengthen their body may find the effect of those herbs being cancelled by the consumption of white carrot.Information provided by Mr Ang Ah Keng, an acupuncturist at the Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution, and Ms Lim Nai Siang, a TCM physician and secretary of the research department at the institution.

This is why a nine-month part-time course, designed to help about 30 per cent of practising acupuncturists get their registration, has a large dose of basic TCM knowledge.The course will be conducted by the two TCM schools here.By Jan 1, 2002, all acupuncturists in Singapore need to be registered. Those who have been practising since July 1985 or have recognised qualifications, such as a degree from select universities in China, qualify for registration.Those with less experience or training either need to go for an appraisal or attend the course and pass the Common Acupuncture Qualifying Examination.The course will include the body's systems, like the blood and kidney systems, and various causes of diseases and their symptoms.Dr Wong Kum Leng, TCM director at the ministry, said about 300 of the roughly 1,100 practitioners will need to sit for the examination, which will be in Chinese.Besides the 300, there are others who may have to go only for an appraisal.The soon-to-be-formed Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board will decide who will be registered automatically and who will be required to pass the appraisal or examination.Dr Wong added that the non-Chinese-speaking acupuncturists will have to study the various subjects on their own, but provisions will be made for them to sit for the test.He pointed out that as there had been no need for registration in the past, some practitioners may not have written records of their practice.However, as the acupuncturist community is small, and most people know each other, it will be possible to establish how long they have been in the business.Dr Wong described the registration of acupuncturists as the first step towards raising the standards of traditional practices. Next on the agenda will be registration of all TCM practitioners. REGISTRATION: For all practitioners BY JAN 1, 2002, all acupuncturists here need to be registered.

109,1110.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,TCM: A need to note changes?,"A LITTLE commotion over definition that has broken over the practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) should be calmed before confusion undermines what is regarded as a treatment alternative for certain medical conditions. One begins on the understanding that as TCM has a state-sanctioned role in health-care choices - mainly in acupuncture and herbal preparations - its practice and statutory monitoring should enjoy the confidence of consumers. This is important as there are as many as 2,400 registered TCM physicians here, about one-third the number of conventionally-trained doctors. It appears that some practitioners are styling themselves as specialists and billing patients more than 'generalists' do. Despite patient unhappiness, fees should not be the bone of contention. What is crucial is that the public be left in no doubt about the extent of competency of TCM physicians across disciplines. As an example, there would be reason to be wary about those who claim to treat certain cancers or neurological disorders. Yet TCM has a long tradition of acceptance, in common with the folk wisdom of other old civilisations in Asia, the Middle East and the Andes.Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has moved quickly to assert that there is no such person as a TCM specialist, and that movement towards a specialists' register will be slow, if found to be feasible. Physicians who continue to present themselves as specialists, for whatever medical condition, can expect to be disciplined, even de-registered. The 2000 Act that mandated TCM practice expressly prohibits descriptions other than as a TCM physician. That, it would seem, is that.But it is not straightforward. The minister's reprimand tacitly addresses public concern about excessive charging, as an effect of misrepresentation. It happens that TCM enjoys good custom among older people and the Chinese-educated, and even beyond this demographic. Sooner or later the public will make known its need for descriptional guidelines to assist them in the choice of TCM physicians to see for specific afflictions. It is a choice patients are entitled to make. It is pointed out by trade groups, such as the Specialist Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre, that those who trained in China study specific fields of treatment. They are, for practical purposes, 'specialists'. Many Singaporean physicians hold accredited Chinese qualifications.The Health Ministry should take its time to consult the profession and review legislation if need be, to take note of the changes in TCM practice that have occured since it was examined for inclusion in public-health policy."
110,1111.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Getting to the heat of the matter,"NOTING that I had been laid low again by my recurring lumbago, my sister gave me some self-heating 'moxa' pads which she had bought when she was last in Seoul.They were as good as real moxibustion, she said, referring to a form of therapy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that uses heat generated by burning a herb to stimulate acupuncture points.The small, spongy herb used is called mugwort or Artemisia vulgaris. The therapy is called moxibustion, meaning combustion of moxa, a monicker derived from the Japanese mogusa (with the 'u' very short, thus mogsa or moxa). The Korean self-heating pads were bags of moxa, charcoal and an oxygen-sensitive system. When a bag is opened and the ingredients shaken, the system heats up. Within minutes, the bag is a comfortable 70 deg C or thereabouts and stays like that for hours.Applied to acupuncture points, it supposedly heals what ails one. Applied to sore muscles directly, it definitely affords some pain relief.In classical moxibustion, the idea is to use heat to warm certain acupuncture points to stimulate the circulation of the qi or life force, so it flows freely around in your body. In TCM, if qi flows freely, health obtains. If the flow is blocked, however, ill health results.The aim in TCM is to get qi flowing smoothly again in a sick person and moxibustion is one mode of doing so.Sometimes a therapist puts a small cone of processed moxa on an acupuncture point and lights it up. But just before the moxa actually burns down to the skin, he deftly pinches it away.The heat thus generated penetrates into the acupuncture point to do its magic. A Seoul National University of Technology study published in the Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology last year reported that this heat penetrates 5mm into the skin.In past times, some therapists would actually allow the moxa to burn down to the skin, which would blister and heal with scarring. An 18th century eyewitness account written by Engelbert Kaempfer called Moxa in China and Japan noted that moxa powder about as much as half a grain of rice was burned directly on the skin. (It was this treatise that gave the technique its present name in English.)Because moxibustion was easier to do than acupuncture, it became widely used as folk medicine so much so that Kaempfer said he met no Japanese who did not have some moxa scarring.Another method currently used is to burn moxa fluff wrapped around the ends of acupuncture needles already inserted into the skin. These metallic needles conduct the heat down into the relevant acupuncture points.Otherwise, a (non-smokable) moxa cigar is lit and the smouldering stick held near to the appropriate acupuncture points or around acupuncture needles if already inserted. This is maintained for a few minutes until the skin turns red.But does it work? There are to be found in the Western and East Asian medical literature many studies addressing this issue in a variety of conditions. There have also been several systematic reviews of such studies.In the last few years, researchers from the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine have done several systematic reviews of these studies that looked at the effectiveness of moxibustion in stroke rehabilitation, hypertension, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, asthma, cancer and constipation.The Korean reviews were published in various journals and all said that the quality of the primary studies was so bad, methodologically speaking, no firm conclusions could be drawn.This unflattering conclusion is akin to that of a 2009 study published in Trials that looked at the methodological shortcomings of clinical trials published in Chinese journals. Scientists from Chengdu, Hong Kong and Ottawa working together located 1,685 studies of TCM therapies said to be randomised controlled trials.They interviewed the authors only to find under 7 per cent were truly randomised controlled trials. Most of these Chinese researchers did not know how to design a rigorous clinical trial, they said.The study concluded 'that so many non-randomised controlled trials... published as randomised controlled trials reflected the fact that peer review needs to be improved' in Chinese research.So the fairest thing that can be said about moxibustion at this juncture is that we have no proof yet that it works.This is sad since it has been used for at least well over a millennium. We know this because, a century ago, some Buddhist manuscripts discovered in a cave at Dunhuang along the Silk Road in north-western China were found to contain sketches of the human body. These turned out to be moxibustion charts dating from the Tang dynasty (AD618 to 907). The charts are now held in the British Museum.Hopefully, we will not have to wait another century for Chinese science to ascertain if moxibustion actually works.andyho@sph.com.sgIn classical moxibustion, the idea is to use heat to warm certain acupuncture points to stimulate the circulation of the qi or life force, so it flows freely around in your body.

Should those with heart murmur avoid acupuncture and other forms of therapy? You may have experienced dizziness and cold sweat because of the pain. It may also be due to nervousness if you are undergoing tui na or acupuncture for the first time.Other factors involve a lack of rest, hunger, high blood pressure and insomnia.You should inform your physician of your heart condition so that he can take that into consideration while treating you. There are certain manipulations and acupuncture points like nei guan, which are used to strengthen the heart.It is common for patients with heart murmur to receive both acupuncture and tui na, depending on the severity of their condition.Physically weak patients and those with severe heart and lung disease should not seek tui na as a form of treatment.You should also avoid tui na if you have a drinking, bleeding or skin problem.For weak or first-time patients, it is advisable to lie down during treatment.My hands and feet are constantly cold, even at room temperature.

It could also be due to a deficiency of the lung, spleen and kidney's function as well as poor qi and blood circulation.Pathogenic factors like 'cold' and 'dampness', an improper diet and/or chronic diseases like gastritis and chronic cough may also play a part.Chinese medicine, acupuncture and tui na can alleviate your symptoms by warming and restoring the yang qi and enhancing the function of the organs. They can also improve the qi and blood circulation and dispel pathogenic factors. You should maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet and regular exercise. Avoid cold drinks as well as oily and sour foods as these will affect the function of the digestive system in absorbing the nutrients and converting them into qi and blood.I'm a 43-year-old woman and suffer from severe pre-menstrual syndrome, which makes me irritable two to three days before my period.

This leads to the impairment of the chong and ren meridians which regulate the menstrual cycle.Chinese medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion (a type of heat treatment where Chinese herbs in the form of a stick are lit and the heat generated is brought near the affected area) and tui na can reduce 'liver-fire', remove the stagnation of qi and replenish yin as well as nourish the kidney.You should consult your physician to identify the cause and receive proper treatment. Also, maintain a healthy lifestyle with sufficient rest.Do not eat cold food as it will retard qi and blood circulation. You should also avoid spicy food which will reduce yin. Keep warm to prevent catching a cold or flu as a woman's immunity is weaker during her period.Information provided by Ms Lim Lay Beng, a TCM physician at YS Healthcare TCM Clinic in The Adelphi."
112,1113.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"About 1,000 Chinese physicians here -most trained locally","Dawn Tan Report on traditional Chinese medicine CHINESE physician Lee Kim Leong has been seeing patients with rheumatism, strokes, and heart and psychiatric problems for 25 years.The 60-year-old acupuncturist treats about 50 to 80 patients daily in his clinic, most of whom go through outpatient treatment, for at least one to two months.One of his regulars is Mr C.L. Chua, 45, an engineer who is receiving acupuncture on his hips after an operation. The treatment will stimulate his nerves and improve his circulation, said Mr Chua, who still finds it painful to walk.Mr Lee, who runs a full-time solo practice, and Mr Chua are typical of the Chinese physician and his patient. A MINISTRY of Health survey, on the practice of traditional Chinese medicine here last year, estimated that there were about 800 to 1,000 Chinese physicians here, three-quarters of whom are male.Two-thirds are aged between 40 and 59, and 76 per cent have at least 10 years' experience.Like 74 per cent of the Chinese physicians here, Mr Lee is locally-trained. He went through a four-year part-time course in the Singapore Chinese Physicians' Training College after secondary school.But Mr Lee, being well known, sees four to five times more patients than the average practitioner, who treats about 10 to 20 patients a day. OVERALL, about 10,000 patients visit Chinese physicians daily. Their treatment is confined to outpatient care, forming 12 per cent of the total daily outpatient attendance.The most commonly prescribed treatment is Chinese medicine in the form of tablets, pills and mixtures. Acupuncture is the next most widely used treatment.On why he chose a Chinese physician over a Western-trained doctor to treat the pain in his hips, Mr Chua said in Mandarin: ""My parents and grandparents believed in Chinese medicine. Whenever I had aches or sprains, I would go to a Chinese physician rather than a Western-trained doctor.""But when I get a flu or a cough, I would go to a Western-trained doctor.""His reply was typical of the 2,530 respondents, aged between 18 and 64, in the same survey.They preferred traditional Chinese medicine to Western medicine for sprains, aches and pains but would rather consult a Western-trained doctor for a cold and other types of illnesses and injury.The study found that about 45 per cent of Singaporeans had consulted a Chinese physician at some time in their lives and 19 per cent did so in the past year. Half of them were aged between 40 and 49 and 55.9 per cent have no formal education."

Housewife Chow See Mui first visited the Annie Tiang TCM Clinic in East Coast Road in August 2014 with her daughter. They bought two packages and health supplements costing more than $3,000. The packages were for acupuncture and tuina, a Chinese therapeutic massage. But during a session on Sept 4, 2014, persuaded by TCM practitioner Xia Rongrong, Madam Chow underwent moxibustion. This involves placing the base of a mugwort - a small, spongy herb-cone - on the skin and burning the tip that is not in direct contact with the skin.  According to court papers, Ms Xia claimed the treatment would promote general health, and was painless, harmless and risk-free. However, it landed Madam Chow, who had only minor aches before the treatment, in hospital for a month with a $95,000 bill, which she managed to claim from her insurance company.  A clinic staff member administered the treatment. In her lawsuit, Madam Chow said she felt extreme pain but was told to bear with it as the treatment was harmless and the pain would subside shortly. She developed blisters the same day. Madam Chow's children called Ms Xia and her husband Joseph Yap, also a TCM practitioner, to tell them her condition was worsening. The couple maintained that the pain would subside without medical attention. On Sept 10, six days after the treatment, Mr Yap went to Madam Chow's home to check on her, and said again that she did not need medical attention, giving her acupuncture instead. But the pain persisted. A few days later, Madam Chow went to Gleneagles Hospital, where she was diagnosed with third-degree burns and warded for a month. After her discharge, she found out a pain in her neck was caused by a plastic piece inserted into her neck during acupuncture. It failed to dissolve as she had been told it would. She had it surgically removed in December 2014. When she brought her claim against the clinic, Ms Xia and Mr Yap, the owners and directors of the clinic, its insurer NTUC Income Insurance Co-operativeinitially offered her over $36,000 for both her damages and legal costs. But she decided to take the claim to court through lawyer Raj Singh Shergill in October last year. In her court papers, she claimed damages on the grounds of negligence and breach of contractual duty of reasonable care and skill. She also sought aggravated damages from the practitioners, for not just causing her burns but also deterring her from seeking medical attention, thus prolonging her pain. The case was resolved last month after the court mediated between both parties. Madam Chow turned down an offer of extra money by the practitioners, offered in return for confidentiality.Past cases involving TCM physiciansJune 2016 A 53-year-old traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician and acupuncturist was fined $5,000 and suspended in June by the TCM Practitioners Boardfor three months after misdiagnosing a 15-year-old pregnant patient. Ms Wu Liping had prescribed the teen herbal medication that might have harmed her and her unborn baby. Ms Wu, then working at Shenzhou Chinese Physician Clinic in Jurong East, had diagnosed the patient's condition as hormonal imbalance after she missed her menstruation for five months.August 2015  An 81-year-old TCM physician who issued medical certificates (MCs) to students without properly assessing their condition was suspended in August last year for three months. She was also fined $2,000. Ms Cheong Thiam Mui issued 122 MCs to 109 students of a private academy over about three months from December 2013 to March 2014 while working as a TCM physician and acupuncturist at Cheong's Clinic in Burlington Square in Bencoolen Street.Treatment not common, say practitioners Moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, involves the burning of a spongy herb called mugwort. In direct moxibustion, the herb, which is dried into thin strips called moxa, is rolled into the shape of a cone or cylinder and placed on the skin. The end not touching the skin is burnt. The moxa is expected to be removed before the burning portion touches the skin. In indirect moxibustion, the moxa stick or cone is kept at a distance from the skin. While indirect moxibustion is widely accepted and used, the direct treatment is not common, said Ms Tjioe Yan Yin, a TCM physician at Nanyang Technological University's Chinese Medicine Clinic. ""Direct moxibustion will definitely cause burns. Some people accept it because they believe that burning stimulates the blood. They expect the burn to recover."" When done right, moxibustion is expected to relieve pain from ailments such as rheumatism, she said. In indirect moxibustion, physicians have to ensure that the moxa is about 3cm to 4cm away from the skin to prevent burns, and check that the heat generated is not too high. Mr Chong Shaw Fong, 69, a TCM practitioner of 42 years, said he does not provide the treatment any more. ""Some patients' skin may not be suitable for this treatment, for example, if they have diabetes and are taking aspirin,"" said Mr Chong, who runs a medical hall in Upper Cross Street. The treatment requires absolute attention and concentration to prevent injury, he said. He has heard of cases of patients getting burnt but these are rare. ""Young people may not trust the treatment but the elderly like it as they are desperate for pain relief,"" he said.Jalelah Abu Baker  Madam Chow, who said she still has residual effects from the burns, said: ""There is a sense of vindication, but my concern remains that no one else in their elderly years, or any person for that matter, should suffer my fate."" Mr Yap said the clinic staff member who carried out the treatment had been working there for about four months and had ""accidentally"" burned Madam Chow's leg during moxibustion. ""As a manager, I will claim responsibility. I am very sorry about this,"" he said.Madam Chow showing injuries on her right thigh (above) from the moxibustion treatment, and a photo of a burn injury near her right knee. ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN"

This will help ease the three-month waiting list at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital to see an acupuncturist.At a soft launch yesterday, Alexandra Hospital's medical director, Dr Aw Tar Choon, said the demand for such services was popular, especially among the elderly, so the extra facility would be a bonus for those who preferred traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In March, the Senior Minister of State for Health, Dr Aline Wong, said TCM had a role in Singapore's health-care system. However, she stressed that its role was to complement Western medicine, not to replace or provide an alternative to it.The new clinic, which has two acupuncturists from Shanghai, will be officially opened by the end of the year and more details about its services will be released later.Yesterday, a Hospital Help Desk for the Elderly manned by 16 senior citizen volunteers was also launched at the hospital by the National Council of Social Service.The MP for Kampong Glam GRC and Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, Mr Loh Meng See, was the guest of honour.Although the council hopes to set up more of such services in other hospitals, it is looking for more people to come forward to volunteer their services.The council's elderly services senior manager, Mr S. Chandra, said: ""There is no monetary incentive, so it's difficult to get people involved. We hope more retirees will come forward to help. It would be ideal because, being senior citizens themselves, they understand the needs of the aged sick better.""With the new service, elderly patients from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) are dropped off at the desk, where a volunteer sees to their needs and takes them to their destination.Veteran volunteer Aw Teck Chin, 74, who has done more than 15 years of community work, said: ""I wish more people would come forward to help out. I tried persuading my friends but they would rather play mahjong."""
115,1116.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Red dates for good digestion; The dried fruit is believed to boost the digestive system and help with blood production. Joan Chew reports,"  You would have snacked on red dates during Chinese New Year, when they are eaten in the wish for a 'sweet' year ahead.   The red date is also prized by the Chinese for its medicinal properties.    Also known as the Chinese date or jujube, it is used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to boost the digestive function of the body.   It is also believed to nourish the blood and qi (energy) and calm a person's spirit, said Ms Zhu Ping, a senior TCM physician at Hua Mei Acupuncture and TCM Centre. The centre was set up by elderly-welfare group Tsao Foundation.    The red date originated in China, where it has been cultivated for more than 4,000 years in the Shanxi, Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, she said.   It is now also grown in India, Russia, the Middle East, southern Europe and the United States.   The deciduous red date tree grows between seven and 10 metres high and produces a cherry-sized fruit that is a drupe, or stone fruit, in its first year.   The immature fruit is green but its skin turns a dark red as it ripens, encasing the sweet white flesh. It is edible fresh, dried or candied with honey.   The fruit can be picked fresh or left on the tree to be picked when it has dried. It does not require sulphur preservatives, unlike other dried fruits.   Dried red dates are sold at $0.85 for a 100g packet or $1.89 for a 150g packet at supermarkets here.   They are eaten as they are or often used in steamed and stewed dishes and desserts.    In TCM, the stomach and spleen work together to convert food into qi.   Good circulation of blood and qi is believed to be required for good health.   When a person overeats, it puts a strain on the digestive system and will result in qi deficiency in the spleen and stomach, said Ms Zhu.   Conversely, a person who eats too little does not receive sufficient nutrients for qi to be produced in the spleen and stomach.   Qi can also become weak in a person who has a stressful lifestyle or a chronic illness such as diabetes.    Aside from the typical signs of qi deficiency, such as fatigue, a weak voice and tendency to sweat easily, a person with qi deficiency specifically in the stomach and spleen will also experience loss of appetite, loose stool and abdominal discomfort.   These point to a sluggish digestive system that should be strenghtened with red dates, said Ms Zhu.   TCM practitioners also believe red dates nourish the spleen's qi so that ample nutrients are transported to the muscles and tissues, thereby strengthening the limbs. This is beneficial for stroke patients who have weak limbs, they believe.   When the spleen is not functioning well, it does not produce enough blood and this indirectly affects the functions of the heart.   Insufficient blood in the body will lead to a deficiency in yin, the aspect of the body that is responsible for moistening and cooling the organs. A balance of yin and heat-linked yang in the body is also needed for good health.   A heart with yin deficiency is not able to provide a stable resting place for the spirit, explained Ms Zhu.    This happens, say, in a woman going through menopause, who may feel irritable or depressed, cry easily and have insomnia, she said.   Consuming red dates would help to nourish the blood and keep the emotions stable.   As they possess slightly 'warm' properties, red dates are not suitable for people who exhibit 'heaty' symptoms such as sore throats, red tongues, mouth ulcers and dry stool, said Ms Zhu.    Women with heavy periods - another sign of 'heatiness' - should refrain from eating red dates until their menstrual period is over, or they risk losing more blood, she added.   While it is safe to eat red dates regularly, one should eat no more than 20 a day to avoid an overactive spleen and stomach, she advised.   In Western medicine, however, red dates have no bearing on menopausal symptoms, which are caused by the declining level of the female hormone oestrogen, said Dr Peter Chew, senior consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Gleneagles Hospital.   At an optimal level, oestrogen stimulates the synthesis of a feel-good chemical called serotonin.   When the oestrogen level drops during menopause, so does that of serotonin, resulting in mood swings and depression.   Dr Chew said there is no known food which can induce the brain to produce serotonin.   Medication can relieve the symptoms of menopause. But some women forgo this, using exercise and their own coping skills to get by, he added.   (Serves two to three)   10g wild black fungus   8 dried red dates   250g pork ribs   3 slices of ginger   1 tbs Chinese rice wine   Salt to taste   Soak the black fungus in cold water until it is softened. Remove the pedicel (stalk) of the black fungus before shredding it into smaller pieces.   Rinse the dried red dates and remove the seeds, if any. Rinse the pork ribs and cut them into smaller pieces.   Fill a pot with 1 litre of water. Put all the ingredients in the pot and bring the water to the boil.    Use a spoon to skim off the foam on the water surface. Add the Chinese rice wine and allow the soup to simmer on low heat for two hours. Add salt to taste before serving the soup hot.

116,1117.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"TCM From sunset to sunrise industry; Younger set drawn to traditional cures, now seen as complementary to Western medicine","TRADITIONAL medicine and treatments, once considered dying out, are making a comeback.These traditional cures, long used by older people, have staked a place in the future by winning over users in their 20s and 30s. The roots of such medicine and treatments, such as acupuncture, are mainly Chinese, though one in 10 people here goes for traditional Malay or Indian medicine.The demand for such cures has pushed up imports of traditional herbs and drugs. Imports from China, the core distributor of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products, leapt 63 per cent in the last five years to hit US $35 million (S $48 million) here last year. Riding on this boom, manufacturers of these products have begun making them in Singapore. A third of the almost 9,000 products here now have made-in-Singapore labels. About $4.5 billion in Singapore-made traditional medicine and health supplements have found their way to Africa, America, Europe and the Middle East.Mr Lim Swee Say, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, speaking at the opening of the first Traditional Medicine Expo yesterday at the Suntec convention centre, noted that as many as three in four people here have tried some form of alternative medicine.The days when traditional medicine comprised dubious or vile-tasting concoctions are long gone.The industry has moved with the times and begun marketing its products as complementary to Western drugs, pitching them at younger users, he said.For example, ICM Pharma is one home-grown drug company that, after having manufactured Western medications and creams for 40 years, has launched an 'East-meets-West' range of TCM products.It now produces, for example, joint-health capsules blending Chinese herbal compounds with glucosamine.Its chief executive, Mr Koe Khoon Poh, said: 'The newer generation may not be able to accept traditional medicine. Why not make it more modern with packaging and scientific production methods?'Tong Jum Chew, another home-grown TCM maker, uses contemporary packaging and has clean rooms in its factory, in line with international standards.It opened its first retail outlet in Tampines this year. Set up to look like a regular chain pharmacy and with a resident Chinese physician on hand, it has attracted customers of all ages, said its general manager, Mr Gerald Tong.He added that many of its customers seek alternative treatments for lifestyle diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes. Not all of them are Chinese. A Malay teenager was in the shop recently, looking for help for her acne problem, Mr Tong said.Mr Lim credited the rise in Singapore's traditional medicine sector to the worldwide interest in complementary medicine, which marries Eastern and Western cures, and the growth of TCM in China.He added that the regulation of TCM drugs, practitioners and training, especially in the last few years, has also boosted customer confidence.The seven-year-old TCM College in Singapore has trained about 1,350 people and enrolment is on the rise.More than 2,000 Chinese physicians are registered now, nearly nine in 10 of them local residents, with the number expected to grow, said Mr Lim.And with Singapore's strong brand name and reputation for quality manufacturing, the Republic can build a niche as a manufacturing centre for traditional medicine products, he added.Medicine aside, traditional treatment methods are being dispensed in clinics, and hospitals - even the private ones - have also set up TCM clinics.Mr Lee Tiong Sa, who chairs the Singapore TCM Organisations Committee, said: 'We used to think of TCM as a sunset industry, but we're now seeing the sun rise.'With a common market in Asean being opened, providing more avenues for cooperation, he is upbeat about the sector's growth prospects.The expo runs until tomorrow. It features 90 exhibitors from Singapore and the region showcasing herbs, traditional medicine and health equipment.aprilc@sph.com.sg"
117,1118.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Sinsehs: Feeling the winds of change,"Ho Sheo Be and Sit Yin Fong There was a time when Chinese physicians here were grey, old men.  Today, they are not only younger and better educated, but many of them are also women, HO SHEO BE and SIT YIN FONG report on Pages Two and Three. TO MANY people, the word sinseh conjures up the image of a grey-haired man frowning as he feels the patient's pulse.But contrary to the common belief that old men dominate the profession, more than half the students pursuing part-time courses on traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in two colleges here are below 40 years old.The change has taken place over the past 10 years in the Singapore Chinese Physicians' Training College (SCPTC), says Mr Chia Kim Lee, 43, a graduate of the college and its executive secretary. He adds, however, that the shift went unnoticed until now. The SCPTC was set up in 1953 by the Singapore Chinese Physicians' Association (SCPA), today a 48-year-old body with a membership of 1,000. It takes in an average of 100 students annually.The other college, the Institute of Chinese Medical Studies (ICMS), has for the past five years seen younger students making up the majority of the intake, says Madam Lee Kait Ying, 57, its principal.The college records an average of 20 students per year and was set up in 1973 by the Association for Promoting Chinese Medicines (APCM), today a 43-year-old organisation with 300 members, including sinsehs and medical hall owners.Students from both colleges are from all walks of life. Says Mr Lee Kim Leong, 58, SCPTC's principal: ""This is a sharp contrast to some 40 years back when most of our students were helpers in Chinese medical halls run by their own families.""Now, about one-third of the students have undergone tertiary education.""He adds that the change came about because of higher entrance requirements. SCPTC and ICMS require students to have at a full A Level certificate. (See other story)Says Mr Tan Pit Lian, 58, vice-president of SCPA: ""In the '50s, primary school leavers became Chinese sinsehs after being trained by experienced masters. But now we believe that highly-educated students can grasp better the profound concepts of Chinese medicine, fare better in the examinations and, subsequently, as physicians.""He tells Life! that 65 per cent of the students SCPTC accepted last year are professionals such as teachers and engineers. A dentist who wants to combine Western and Chinese medicine graduated from the college two years ago, he says.Mr Lee has also noticed an increase in the number of students who speak English fluently. Almost 90 per cent of students in SCPTC are bilingual, he says.""More non-Chinese have sought consultation from Chinese sinsehs over the past five years. At least five Indonesians visit my clinic every day. Being able to speak English helps us to communicate with these patients effectively,"" he says.Why do tertiary-educated individuals and professionals aspire to become Chinese sinsehs? Mr Tan, who owns a clinic, says the reason is because of the profession's better image.""Many schools, private companies and organisations now accept medical certificates that we give to our patients. The government is also currently planning to register Chinese sinsehs,"" he says.Chinese sinsehs have indeed been getting more attention. Just two months ago, Health Minister Brigadier-General (NS) George Yeo suggested that Chinese sinsehs, who currently do not come under the purview of the ministry, be registered.Last month, Mr Peh Chin Hua, an MP for Jalan Besar GRC, urged the two colleges to unite and form a central body to improve their standing in the community.Government attention has cast a bright new light on the practice, says Madam Tsao Su Hua, 36, a student of SCPTC. The Taiwanese housewife sees a possibility af synthesising traditional medicine and Western practices. She gained confidence in Chinese medicine after it helped her to conceive her first child, she adds.Meanwhile, Mr Lee Chwee Hock, 35, a graduate from SCPTC, says practising Chinese medicine is something worthwhile. Adds the project engineer and a volunteer at the Chung Hwa Free Clinic which was established by SCPA in 1952: ""It is something I can continue to do even after my retirement.""He attributes the increasing interest in the profession to the opening up of China.He adds: ""Countries interested in doing business in China want to learn more of its culture, including its medicine. Everyone tends to follow the giant."""

It is important for students to get a degree in Chinese medicine from a university which is accredited.The International Medical University's (IMU) Bachelor of Science (Hons) Chinese Medicine is accredited by MQA (Malaysian Qualifications Agency).The graduate also must complete internship training in an accredited Chinese medicine hospital.IMU has collaborated with many partner universities in China for IMU graduates to complete this one year internship. This is needed for registration to practice with Ministry of Health once the Traditional and Complementary Healthcare Practices Bill is passed by Parliament in the near future.Once registered with the Ministry of Health, the Chinese medicine practitioner can work in integrated healthcare in any government or private hospital or clinic.A qualified practitioner can also open up their own clinic to practice. The Chinese medicine practitioner can further specialise in many areas like acupuncture, moxibusion, tuina, bone manipulations, Chinese classics and many other specialties like paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, neurology or geriatric diseases.With additional postgraduate qualifications, the Chinese medicine practitioner can also work as a lecturer in an institution of higher learning.Alternatively, this practitioner can also be a researcher in an academic institution or herbal or pharmaceutical manufacturing company or be a specialist in a hospital.At the IMU in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, students who are interested in this course have the option to complete the entire four-year Chinese medicine programme at IMU or transfer part of the programme to one of the university's partners in Australia or China.Through this arrangement with the partner universities, IMU's Chinese medicine students wishing to move on to one of these partner universities will receive academic credits for the subjects they have successfully completed in IMU and use these towards the completion of their degree.Partner universities for this programme are RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, Shanghai University of TCM, China, Shandong University of TCM, China and Guangzhou University of TCM, China.Under this collaboration, students will study up to three years at IMU and then spend the second part of their programme at one of these partner universities, where they would graduate.Partner universities in China, mentioned above, together with the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine have also agreed to take IMU graduates for the one-year internship required by the Malaysian government for registration as a Chinese medicine practitioner.The Chinese medicine programme in IMU is also accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and taught in a medical university which also offers medical and health sciences programmes.The first intake for the Chinese medicine programme is in February.Applications are now open and the IMU welcomes students with pre-university qualifications to join.For more information, call 03-27317272 or visit www.imu.edu.my( END )"

It comprises herbal treatment, acupuncture, diet therapy and massage.The practices are based on observing and adapting to nature, the universe as well as the human body, which has been studied for thousands of years. The concept of balance such as ying and yang, the circulatory system, organ theory and the likes are emphasised.In traditional Chinese medicine, among its mainstay practices are:Acupuncture, which is derived from Latin acus (needle) and pungere (to prick), is a procedure where practitioners insert fine needles into various points of the body to increase energy (qi) flow and balance in the body.Diet therapy, which is the recommended diet according to the needs of individual patients based on the five elements theory of Chinese herbalism.

Nearby, another patient is taking Western medicine before going for acupuncture at the Chinese wing. Tung Shin, which was set up in the late 19th century, opened 12 traditional Chinese medicine wings in February this year - with physicians trained in a range of fields, including acupuncture, orthopaedics, oncology and gynaecology.And although the 15 traditional Chinese doctors and 37 Western-trained doctors operate separately in different wings, the hospital does offer integrated medicine.Lam Wah Ee Hospital in Penang, however, has opted not to integrate - for now.Tung Shin's Chinese Medical Department head Professor Zhao Tian Yong says they don't exchange opinions about a patient's condition or plan treatment together. But they do suggest appropriate treatments to their patients.As an oncologist, he recommends surgery and chemotherapy to his patients if they need it, but he also uses traditional Chinese medicine which, he says, can protect the patient and reduce side effects of chemotherapy such as thirst.""This also happens in the Western Medical Department. Their doctors will recommend coming here if they feel traditional Chinese medicine is more suitable for them,"" he says.At Lam Wah Ee Hospital, medical superintendent Datuk Dr Yip Kok Thye says his Western division and the traditional Chinese division do not recommend or refer patients to each other, ""but they are free to move to either side on their own accord"".Yip is cautious about combining both schools of treatment.""We need more information and very good clinical trials on whether integrated medicine works and complements Western treatment,"" he warns.The Ministry of Health is taking the right step by conducting a pilot project first, he says."

Many visitors to the presentation ceremony of Hari Raya cookies to the serving military men at the Pekan Umno building, were again taken aback when they came in and saw a lone Malay army doctor performing the treatments, traditionally the domain of the Chinese.After two years of offering traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a complementary treatment at the military hospitals, Colonel Dr Zubir Ahmad who heads the first-ever Acupuncture Clinic at the Armed Forces Hospital in Section 2, Wangsa Maju, Kuala Lumpur, is used to these reactions.Dr Zubir who studied the subject for a year in 2007 at a TCM university in Shanghai, said he was honoured to be given the chance to pioneer the treatment at the military hospitals.""The clinic offers pain management therapy for patients with chronic pain and the treatment of acupuncture and cupping are either given as complementary or as an alternative medicine.""Since we opened in April, we have received many referrals from our specialist clinics at the hospital and from government hospitals nearby,"" said Dr Zubir, who heads the four-member team at the clinic.The 52-year-old father of five, with 25 years of service, said his interest in TCM stemmed from his frustration with modern medicine which mainly promoted the use of painkillers to manage pain.However, it took some doing for him to convince his superiors to allow him to go for the one-year training, with a grant from the Chinese People's Liberation Army.Since the grant only covered the fee and allowance, he had to seek additional funding from the armed forces.""I was the only Malaysian in the class of 35 and I had to rely on a translator. It was hard at first as TCM is completely different from modern medicine.""Some of my colleagues thought I was crazy for wanting to study TCM at my age as I was 49 at the time but luckily my family supported me.""I had to re-tune my way of thinking but it was worth it when I saw patients with chronic pain like osteo-arthiritis gradually reduce their visits after treatment.""Dr Zubir who went on to prescribe a blend of modern and TCM after his return, said the idea of an acupuncture clinic was mooted by Armed Forces Health Medical Services director-general, Lieutenant-General Datuk Seri Dr Sulaiman Abdullah last year.""Our clinic is small with only two beds and our services are limited as I am the only one who can perform the acupuncture and cuppings.""The number of patients is limited to eight people per day and so far we've had 98 patients from referrals.""I hope there will be other army doctors who will be interested in studying TCM so we can expand the operations.""( END )"
122,1123.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Indians try cupping as Phelps boosts this pain relieving technique,"Long before the purple bruises on swimmer Michael Phelps's body hit the head lines, Mumbai doctor Sahil Sheikh was a fan of cupping. Nagged by a chronic shoulder problem, the 35-year-old decided to try this alternative therapy. ""Apart from mild dizziness immediately after the session, there were no side-effects,"" he says. But he did report relief from pain.Like Sheikh, many Indians have become cupping devotees. The therapy, which has its origins in traditional Chinese medicine and the unani system, involves placing small cups, often heated, on the body part that needs healing. A partial vacuum is created inside the cups and when these are lifted after a few minutes, it sucks out disease-causing fluids and energy (qi), resulting in localized healing. The therapy has many celebrity followers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, Victoria Beckham, Justin Bieber and most recently athlete Michael Phelps sported the red round marks left by the cups at Rio Olympics.There's no scientific proof on the efficacy of cupping but that hardly gets in the way of its popularity. Mohammad Shahid Malik, a Unani doctor, runs cupping clinics in Delhi and Aligarh and reports that ever since the Phelps news came out, enquiries have spiked. ""People have also been calling to find out how to become a cupping practitioner,"" says Dr Malik, who does 25-30 cupping sessions per month. Dr Syed Izharul Hasan, who works under the AYUSH ministry and has a clinic at Rashtrapati Bhavan, says the practice is already quite popular in India. ""The Olympic story might have given cupping more space in the public eye but people already knew about it. We have treated lakhs of people till now,"" he claims.Cupping therapists claim it's an effective pain reliever and also improves overall wellbeing and energy levels. Dr Madhu Sudan Aggarwal, a popular Delhi acupuncturist, says that cupping is, in fact, a form of acupuncture. ""It's an age-old way of treating sprains and muscular pains but it also provides relief in neuro and muscular problems to a certain extent, and has some impact on fertility. Skin ailments also respond well to cupping.""And now therapists recommend it for anti-ageing. Facial cupping is said to be a natural face lift, resulting in greater blood flow to the face, reduced puffiness and tightened skin. The suction effect of the cups also helps in decreasing cellulite. Cosmetic cupping services are available in India.Despite its popularity, cupping re mains controversial. In June, a Chinese man in Chengdu suffering from frozen shoulder had to be hospitalized after a faulty cupping session at a massage par lour. The therapist did the procedure too many times and on the same locations, severely infecting those areas. Dr Malik cautions that it is best to undergo this therapy at a registered clinic and by a practitioner who has a recognized degree in allopathy, homoeopa thy or ayurveda.DOTS FOR KNOTSDry cuppingCups that have been heated or have an attached pump are placed on the affected part.

123,1124.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Wonders of Pestle Needle in Cervical Pain,"Chennai, May 24 -- Cervical spondylosis is a common problem among the middle-aged and the elderly. However, in recent years, increasing number of cases has been observed in the younger population. Since 1996, we have chosen pestle needle to treat the patients with cervical spondylosis and keep comparing its effectiveness with regular acupuncture.A comparative study between regular and special acupuncture was done by Jiang Zhenya and Li Chengdu at the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.Total 60 patients were randomly divided into the pestle needle group (treatment group) and the regular acupuncture group (control group) with 30 patients in each group. Treatment MethodsTreatment GroupPoints: Dazhuibazhen, C4-C7 Jiaji (EX-B2), Jianyu (LI15), Quchi (LI11), Waiguan (SJ5). The location of Dazhuibazhen: 1 cun, 2 cun, 3 cun lateral to the Dazhui (GV, DU 14).Manipulation: The patients were seated with their upper limbs loosened and heads hanging slightly. The pestle needle is made of ox horn, jade, and metal of 10 cm length. It comprises a tip, a handle, and a body. The needle was held in the same manner as a pencil is held. The pestle needle was pressed on Dazhuibazhen from shallow to deep in the skin repeatedly. The pestle was manipulated for 30 minutes.The patients were treated once daily, one course of treatment consisted of six sessions with a one-day interim between the courses. Fili form needles (diameter: 0.38 mm, length: 50 mm) were used on the other points. Jiaji (EX-B2) was needled bilaterally to a depth that caused numbness and distension or an electrical sensation. The points on the attacked limbs were needled to a depth that caused numbness or distension. The needles were retained for 30 minutes and manipulated once every 10 minutes. The patients received the same treatment once each day. One course consisted of six sessions. Traction was used as a supplementary treatment.Control GroupExcept for Dazhuibazhen, the points needled and the manipulation were similar to those used in the treatment group. A comparison of the curative effect was given after three courses.RESULTSComparison of score between groups: before treatment, the scores of the treatment group and the control group are 12.37 +/- 3.26 and 12.24 +/- 3.18, P>0.05. After treatment, the former is 6.40 +/- 1.82 and the latter is 6.52 +/- 1.96. By comparing before-treatment with after-treatment, there was a significant improvement in two groups (P 0.05) but there was a statistical difference with the cured rate (P < 0.05).DISCUSSIONCervical spondylosis, is a syndrome whose characteristics are cervicodynia, omalgia, numbness of upper limbs, vertigo, fatigue, cataplexy, abnormal sweating, staggering gait and paralysis due to degeneration of the intervertebral disc of the neck and hyperosteogeny of the cervical vertebrae. The pestle needling therapy, as a special form of acupuncture, was first adopted by the well-known practitioner Li Zhongyu. It relaxes the cervical anatomy tissue, enhances blood circulation, facilitates absorption of local inflammation to relieve the pressure on the nerve fiber and enables the patient to return to his or her normal activities.Published by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

124,1125.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Puncture rising blood pressure,"Chennai, Oct. 6 -- Hypertension is classified as dizziness or headache in traditional Chinese medicine. Hypertension is caused by the imbalance of body's yin and yang. It is also caused by the functional disorder of Zang-Fu (anatomical) organs, qi and blood circulation. Acupuncture usually helps regulate qi and blood, and adjust Zang-Fu functions. Modern studies have shown that acupuncture plays a regulatory role in vegetative nervous function including cardiovascular function, or strengthening the body's physical mechanism. With no side effects and as a useful no-drug therapeutic method, acupuncture has proved effective in treating hypertension. Huanqiu Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Hospital in China carried out a study to assess how effective is acupuncture in treating hypertension. It took a sample of 70 patients suffering from hypertension, 43 were male and 27 female, two patients were less than 38 years of age; 14 were in the age group of 40-49; 24 were in the 50-59 years age bracket, and 30 were above 60 years of age. The span of illness varied from 25 days to 15 years.Therapeutic methodAcupuncture points were selected and needled. Needles were retained for half an hour. The treatment was given once a day. One therapeutic course comprises ten treatments.CriteriaCure: Symptoms like headache and dizziness disappear, and blood pressure drops to within a normal range. A follow-up period of 6 months shows that the therapeutic effect is stable.Excellent: Symptoms like headache and dizziness vanish and the blood pressure drops to a normal level. However, there is a possibility of a relapse within 6 months requiring further treatment.Effective: Symptoms are less after the treatment; blood pressure varies between the normal and the critical hypertension level.Failure: The symptoms may be less after the treatment, but the blood pressure remains high or above the normal range.Therapeutic resultAll 70 patients were under observation for three years. Thirty-three were cured, 26 obtained excellent therapeutic effect, six were effective, and five failed. The total therapeutic effective rate reached 90 per cent. Of the 33 cured cases, hypertension relapsed with four, but were cured after further treatment.Typical caseA 56 year old male patient, visited the hospital, complaining of headache, dizziness and distending pain in the head, bitterness in the mouth and dry throat complicated by deafness and tinnitus. The symptoms were frequently sporadic. His blood and urine samples were tested and his chest X-rayed, with no abnormalities found. His case was diagnosed as hypertension of degree I. Treatment with traditional herbal and modern medicines showed no effect. His blood pressure was 200/160 mm Hg with exaggerated heart beat. Acupuncture points were selected and was given treatment once daily and after two treatments the patient began to feel better. After one therapeutic course ( of 10 treatments), there were no longer any subjective symptoms. Blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg. The patient was advised to avoid eating pungent food and getting upset. He was completely cured after two therapeutic courses.Follow-up observations for two years subsequent to the treatment showed no relapse whatsoever.kapuracu@kapuracu.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

125,1126.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,A cup of good health?,"CHENNAI: At the Rio Olympics, when Michael Phelps literally rose head and shoulders above his competitors, what struck viewers was not just his prowess, but the purple bruises that covered his shoulders and back. The much celebrated swimmer had brought cupping, which has its origins in traditional Chinese medicine and the unani system, under the Olympic spotlight, but the therapy has long had its fans in the city.Advocate H C Manoharan, for instance, was willing to give the alternative therapy a shot after battling chronic back pain for years. ""I couldn't walk properly or even stand for more than five minutes.  And none of the doctors I met over the years were able to offer relief,"" says Manoharan, who went to a clinic in Koyambedu, which offered cupping therapy, about nine months ago. ""Though I still have problem when I have to stand for long, my backache is better and I am able to climb stairs,"" he says.In cupping therapy, small cups, usually made of glass, are placed on the body part that needs healing. Though there various types including dry, wet, and massage cupping, the technique is similar. Usually cotton, dipped in spirit, is lit in the glass cup. Since the flame burns away the oxygen in the cup, it creates a vacuum and a suction effect, which sticks the cup to the body. The cups are pulled away after a few minutes, leaving behind reddish purple bruises that fade with time.Earlier, Hollywood celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston have flaunted their cupping marks. While athletes often use it to ease aches and pains, practitioners in the city say they use it to treat everything from migraine and body ache to stress and depression.T N Parimala Selvi, therapist at Jayanth Acupuncture, Koyambedu, has been offering cupping in the city since 2014. ""I use it in combination with acupuncture,"" says Selvi, who learnt the technique from Korean Dr Kim Daewon.""We do wet cupping, which involves making small incisions on the skin to remove 'harmful' blood, and also dry cupping,"" says Selvi, adding that while they don't get sportspersons, they get many patients suffering from arthritis and obesity.M A Fenazir, who runs AL-Shifa Acupuncture Clinic in Pallavaram, has been offering cupping for the last four-and-a-half years. ""It works well for emergency pain relief. For instance, it gives instant relief to people with migraines,"" she says, adding that they offer various kinds of cupping. Sessions can range from 30mins to an hour.After the Olympic attention the therapy has received, city practitioners say they are getting more clients. ""Usually, I get 100 patients a month, now every day I am handling about a dozen clients,"" says Fenazir.But doctors have a word of caution, Dr Madhu Thottappillil, who specialises in sports medicine, says he wouldn't recommend it to athletes or anybody else. ""There is not enough scientific empirical evidence to show that cupping helps. Right now it is more of a fad, almost like a placebo. I don't think it is totally without harm,"" he says.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
126,1127.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,A Point to Perfect Blood Count,"Chennai, May 23 -- Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a condition of isolated low platelet count with normal bone marrow, is an immune thrombocytopenia with unclear pathology. So far, no particularly effective therapy has been discovered. On the basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and the clinical manifestations of the disease, the author Yin Zhifang treated 74 patients with acupuncture only or with a combination of acupuncture and medication. Another 24 patients were treated with medication only, and they were considered as the control group. Of the 98 patients, 29 were males and 69 were females. The age ranged from 19 to 58 years. The course of the disease varied from 3 months to 18 years. The 98 patients were divided into three groups at random, for example, acupuncture only group (36 cases), acupuncture and medication group ( 38 cases), and medication only group ( 24 cases). The 98 patients were diagnosed on the basis of their clinical symptoms and a laboratory examination. There were no obvious differences in sex, age, course of disease, and the patients' condition among the three groups. One week before the treatment , patients were instructed to stop taking any medication.It was found that the acupuncture plus medication group recorded better results than the other two groups, and there was a significant difference between the groups. The acupuncture only group recorded better results than the medication group. This suggests that acupuncture is more effective than Western medication in the treatment of the disease.According to TCM theory, ITP is caused by an insufficiency of vital essence and blood in the Zang-fu organs, and can be categorized as a 'Deficiency syndrome'. Dysfunctions of the spleen and the kidney are the cause of symptoms such as dizziness, lassitude, insomnia, soreness in the loins, bleeding and ecchymosis, and threadlike and weak pulse. As a consequence, the therapeutic principle should be to invigorate the kidney and activate the spleen, enhance Qi, and regulate blood. The points to be used during treatment are Dazhui-at the intersection of the Governor vessel and the three Yang meridians, as well as three other points that can increase the platelet count, namely, Zusanli-the He (Sea) point of the stomach meridian, Sanyinjiao -at the intersection of three foot Yin meridians, and Taixi-the Yuan (primary) point of the kidney meridian. The observation and study of the indices in this report suggest that acupuncture therapy is likely to promote the maturation of the myeloid megalocaryocyte, and restore the function of the hematopoietic system. When acupuncture therapy is combined with Western medication, the curative effect can be even more remarkable and the clinical symptoms are more effectively controlled.kapuracu@kapuracu.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

127,1128.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Acupuncture checks excess weight gain,"Obesity is caused by a multitude of reasons. Chief among them are hormonal imbalance, lack of exercise, overeating, bingeing on junk food, sedentary lifestyle, slow metabolism, stress and depression.While there are as many remedies on offer to lose that excess weight, there's one which isn't just part of traditional Chinese medicine but is also endorsed by the World Health Organisation and The United States National Institutes of Health: Acupuncture, a science that is able to address almost all the factors associated with being overweight. It does so by providing a multi-pronged approach to the weight-gain problem by restoring bodily functions to normality so to bring about an equilibrium and thereby, control the factors leading to obesity. Reduces appetite, enhances energyObesity consultant Dr Amrapali Patil says that acupuncture can bring about weight loss by different mechanisms. ""It can blunt craving for food, bringing about 'homoeostasis' in the body, thereby adjusting the 'milieu int�rieur' of the body to normality.""For instance, blood sugar dips are known to cause hunger pangs. The doctor explains, ""When the blood sugar level is normal, there is no unhealthy increase in appetite. Acupuncture achieves this by enabling one to eat less by reducing requirement of food while enhancing the body's ability to effectively utilise the energy obtained from food consumed. This means that though appetite and food requirement decrease, one feels highly energetic and refreshed at all times.""Metabolism boostThe basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the body can be upped with the help of acupuncture. ""So, while appetite decreases, energy is replenished and the body's metabolism actually increases. This creates a negative caloric balance and the weight gets yanked down,"" says Dr Patil.More effective digestionAcupuncture enables the digestive system to process food effectively.Hormone regulationAcupuncture regulates ghrelin and leptin, hormones associated with being overweight and obese.Stress-busterBeing overweight causes stress, leading to wrong choices that lead to weight gain. Acupuncture releases endorphins ('happiness hormones') present in the body, resulting in a calming, tranquilising effect that brings about a feeling of well-being and positive mood elevation.Aids liver functionIt promotes functioning of liver to its optimal level. The liver is an organ that doesn't just aid metabolism but also is imperative to glycogen storage, decomposition of red bloof cells, plasma proteing synthesis, hormone production and detoxification. Dr Patil states,""A regulated liver function means a proper metabolic rate and health at its best. This aids enormously in weight loss.""Acupuncture claims to:- Reduce cravings- Increase metabolism- Reduce abdominal fat- Improve insulin resistance- Detox bodyOpposing opinionWeight-loss clinics in our city that use acupuncture, also have nutritionists who prescribe a low-cal diet that aids weight loss. Others use electro-muscular stimulation and procedures that need follow-ups, wherein excess weight is taken care of by an in-house dietician. Since there are no scientific studies, in my knowledge, to study the impact of acupuncture on weight-loss in isolation, I don't think it has an effect. We have operated many patients who have lost weight through these means but their weight always came back. Despite these procedures, weight re-gain possibility is very high.-- Dr Ramen Goel, Bariatric surgeonFor Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

128,1129.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Be Up and About With Acupuncture,"Chennai, May 10 -- Ankle sprain is a common condition of the motor system. It occurs when the balance of the body is broken, causing a sudden change in the center of gravity of the ankle joint. When the ankle joint is at the state of planter flexion, a slight movement of both sides of the tarsomegaly causes the ankle joint to become unsteady. As a result, a sprain occurs. A study was conducted by the acupuncture department, Henan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhongzhou, China to evaluate its effectiveness in treating ankle sprains. Of the 126 cases, 70 were males and 56 females; the oldest was 56-years-old and the youngest 15-years-old; the shortest course was three hours and the longest course was one year. Most patients were treated within two days of a sprain. The main acupuncture point was Qiuxu (GB40) in the non-affected leg. Filiform needles (diameter: 0.38 mm, length: 40 mm) were used. For patients with serious sprain; combination of cold therapy, massage, and TDP helped to obtain excellent results. Treatment was given once a day; one course consisted of seven days of treatment.Observation of curative effectCured: The ankle joint recovered its normal functions, pain disappeared, the patient could walk as before. Marked effect: The clinical symptoms almost disappeared, pain was relieved significantly, there was minimal pain when walking. Moderate effect: The clinical symptoms were improved, pain was relieved, ankle joint function improved after treatment. No effect: Symptoms and physical signs showed no improvement.ResultsOf the 126 cases, 98 cases (77.78 per cent) were completely cured, 17 cases (13.49 per cent) showed a marked effect, eight cases (6.35 per cent) showed a moderate effect, and there was no effect in three cases (2.38 per cent).Typical caseA 21-year-old male student, was first seen on December 10, 1993. He had sprained ankle joint going down the stairs. Examination showed red swelling and tenderness in the lateral malleolus; he could not walk without aid. He was referred to the department of acupuncture and was treated with the above method. Pain was relieved significantly after 10 minutes. The needles were retained for 30 minutes, and the treatment was given once a day. After four treatments, the red swelling and tenderness disappeared, and he was cured.DiscussionQiuxiu(GB40), which has a powerful analgesic effect, is located at the starting point of the extensor digitonimbrevis where the lateral anterior malleolar artery and vein are distributed; the branches of later dorsal cutaneous nerve of the foot and the superficial peroneal nerve are also located there. Puncturing this point diverts the focus of excitation of pain in the cerebral cortex, or directly stimulates the afferent nerves and blocks afferent pain fibers. The opposite needling method, which involves the selection of points contralateral to the affected side, is often used to treat patients with pain and dysfunction.Published by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

129,1130.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Beat Post-traumatic Stress with Needle,"Chennai, Oct. 25 -- Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to treat mental illnesses. Yet there are no extant clinical or research models in contemporary psychiatry for using acupuncture to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A few preliminary clinical studies utilising various designs and clinical methods have, however, reported reductions in anxiety.We conducted a pilot study with the following objectives: (1) To develop a TCM-acupuncture diagnostic and treatment protocol for PTSD(2) To evaluate the potential efficacy of acupuncture for treating PTDS in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).Our design to evaluate the potential included a no-treatment wait-list group to control the natural history of PTSD in the recruited population and a standard treatment control for testing relative intervention efficacy.Design: Individual acupuncture sessions were conducted twice a week for one hour, and group CBT was conducted once a week for two hours. After a three-month follow-up, maintenance of treatment effects was assessed.The standard acupuncture point prescription combined front and back treatments to avoid point fatigue. The front treatment used 11 needles and the back treatment used 14 needles along with bilateral at different points. There were 15 other points from which up to three flexibly prescribed points could be added to the 25 prescribed needles. Different needling techniques for standard points could also be used to address a participant's specific diagnosis or constitution.Individual treatment sessions were conducted for one hour twice per week, and included a standard TCM interview about symptoms, pulse and tongue evaluation, needle insertion, manipulation, and retention, and ear-seed placement .Lifestyle advice was limited and given only in response to direct questions by participants or if a behaviour was seriously affecting symptoms related to diagnosis and constitution.Discussion: This randomised controlled pilot trial indicates that acupuncture may be efficacious for reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and impairment in people diagnosed with DSM-IV PTSD. Acupuncture provided treatment effects similar to a group CBT intervention, and both interventions were superior to a wait-list control condition for all outcome measures. Furthermore, treatment effects of both acupuncture and group CBT were maintained for three months after the end of treatment.kapuracu@kapuracu.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

130,1131.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,TCM expansion in Kazakhstan,"A Kazakh (left) learns cupping therapy from a teacher at a medical school in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province. File photo: ICKazakhstan, the Central Asian country where Chinese leaders put forward the Belt and Road initiative, is now witnessing the popularization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The rising popularity is mostly thanks to the wider acceptance of TCM, as local perceptions of healthcare have shifted from being treatment-focused to prevention-driven, which is in line with TCM philosophy. While a number of domestic TCM manufacturers aim to tap Kazakhstan's huge market, industry insiders are warning of several hurdles in terms of legal application and cultural acceptance. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as acupuncture, cupping, scraping therapy as well as herbal medicine, is now appealing to more and more patients in Kazakhstan, including 35-year-old Kazakh resident Panar who lives in Almaty, the Central Asian country's largest city. ""I'm now obsessed with TCM culture... I used to be skeptical about what the herbal leaves could do at first, but my attitude drastically shifted in 2014 because at that time, TCM therapy effectively controlled my mom's hyperglycemia,"" Panar told the Global Times over the weekend, noting that she has since then started to learn the medical theory of TCM.In tandem with Panar's attitude changes are the growing interests of Kazakh people in TCM therapy.  Zhu Cuimei, a Chinese national who operates a TCM clinic in Almaty, told the Global Times over the weekend that in recent years, foot massages have been increasingly welcomed in Kazakhstan, despite a relatively high price of 100 yuan ($14.59) per massage. ""Several years ago, there were merely two or three TCM clinics in Kazakhstan, but now there are plenty of them,"" Panar said. Rising interestsThe booming Kazakh TCM healthcare sector is partly due to closer industry cooperation between China and Kazakhstan under the Belt and Road (B&R) initiative, Abai Baygizhin, chairman of the board of the Kazakh National Scientific Medical Center, told the Global Times. In January 2017, Chinese authorities rolled out a road map to boost TCM in countries and regions along the B&R routes. Under the plan, China will set up 50 TCM communication and exchange centers in B&R countries and regions, and will promote 20 TCM international practice standards until 2020. So far, TCM has spread to 180 countries and regions across the world, and 103 member states of the World Health Organization have already granted approval for the practices of Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion. Meanwhile, 18 members have included them in their medical insurance provisions, according to media reports. In addition to government support, TCM usage is gaining widespread recognition among other Central Asian countries, Baygizhin explained. And even Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has become a firm supporter of TMC. The entrance of TCM into the Kazakh market has filled a vacancy for medicine in a country where residents' perceptions of health have been changing from being ""treatment-focused"" to ""prevention-driven,"" Baygizhin said. And TCM's philosophy, with its unique advantages in preventing diseases, is in line with Kazakh people's health pursuits. Rapid expansionAt the same time, the Central Asian country is also eager to attract foreign investment into the local TCM industry. Kamalzhan Nadyrov, head of the Astana health department, told the Global Times that the Kazakh government is now actively improving laws and regulations in the healthcare industry and studying potential tax-cut policies to further promote the country's cooperation with foreign TCM-related companies, including those from China. And Kazakhstan's friendly business environment could be an edge, Nadyrov said. ""We also hope that the development of the TCM industry could drive Kazakhstan's medical tourism, attracting more tourists from neighboring countries to visit,"" Svetlana Saukenova, head of Kazakhstan-based Arman Family and Medical Law Firm, told the Global Times. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan - the place where Chinese leaders first put forward the B&R initiative and the leading economy in Central Asia - is also raising the eyebrows of many Chinese investors for its huge market potential in TCM treatment, Yu Jianglin, global executive president of herbal health products developer Infinitus (China) Company, told the Global Times over the weekend. Beijing Tong Ren Tang European Holding Co, and several other investment firms, have signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Medical Center Hospital of the President's Affairs Administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan on setting up the Tong Ren Tang TCM Healthcare Center in the capital city of Astana.Among with Tong Ren Tang, Infinitus' application to set up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan was also approved by local authorities on September 4. Yu said that the move marks an important step for the group's expansion in Central Asia, and through the institution, the company could better understand local market demand while driving local employment and healthcare industry growth.""For the next step, Infinitus is planning to cooperate with local medical institutions and universities to further facilitate the application of TCM in the national medical system and to complement the country's healthcare industry,"" Yu noted.However, hurdles still remain in terms of figuring out how TCM theories could be widely accepted among Western medical practitioners, considering that the theoretical system of TCM is ""totally different"" from Western medicine, noted Wu Zhendou, deputy director of the International Cooperation Department of the State Administration of TCM.Furthermore, ""there are legal barriers in terms of TCM qualifications and drug access, and the shortage of foreign TCM talent is also an urgent problem,"" Wu said.http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/58/153740955672.jpeg"
131,1132.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Overseas KOLs help promote TCM tourism,"Illustration: Peter C. Espina/GTChina has been cultivating Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) to promote traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tourism, and the experiment is paying off well. In mid-September, a group of overseas KOLs gathered in Beijing as guests of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development to experience traditional Chinese medicine, in its wide variety of forms such as acupuncture, ear candling, cupping, tai chi, herbal pill preparation, and medicinal sachet making.The group, coming from Russia, Spain, Mexico, and Malaysia, had the opportunity to engage with local TCM practitioners to better understand how treatment and services can be rendered. TCM tourism has been promoted to - and well received by - China's aging urban population keen on a healthy retirement lifestyle.The appeal to affluent middle-class seniors is natural, as it is they who most desire to return to their essential roots and detach from the modern hustling. But the idea of promoting TCM to foreigners is relatively new, which is why China is leveraging the experiment on overseas KOLs.In March, China announced the country's first batch of TCM tourism industry bases.  As a joint effort by the China National Tourism Administration and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 73 TCM tourist destinations were announced and expected to attract droves of visitors from home and abroad.The integration of TCM with tourism offers an opportunity where overseas KOLs can discover cool destinations and fun experiences. There are, however, caveats when attracting potential foreign tourists. The sometimes enigmatic potency of TCM, in its many exotic forms, comes with both charm and pitfalls.When it comes to TCM, there has been a lot of hype about its miraculous curing powers, to the extent of being supernatural; there are many myths and misunderstandings that undermine TCM's credibility. Basically, the philosophical foundation of TCM, expressed in terms like ""yin-yang"" and ""wuxing (the five phases),"" is totally different from modern Western medical science.Though there is a huge scientific debate about TCM's philosophical roots, the many forms of traditional Chinese medicine such as acupuncture and herbal nutrients have long been proven effective through solid empirical evidence. Indeed, just like yoga from India, TCM is appealing to global audiences keen on exploring different and innovative ways to improve their health and wellness. Therefore, the strategy to convince KOLs first is clever one, in that the message about TCM, its potency, effects and related touristic activities will be delivered by communications experts with subtlety and nuances to ensure both scientific rigorousness and an effective pitch. TCM tourists destinations across China must also be staffed by personnel who have the necessary knowledge and sensitivity to provide international customers with quality service based on sound science. There are many ways TCM can help, nurture, cure, and care the sick and the infirm, and there are TCM businesses and practitioners who look to offer sales and service beyond China. There is every reason for TCM-themed tourism to be both fun and conducive to a healthy body and mind. Overseas KOLs can help convey the right message and let international customers looking for new and innovative medicine to benefit from their trip to China.This article was published on the Global Times Metropolitan section Two Cents page, a space for reader submissions, including opinion, humor and satire.

132,1133.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,TCM professor at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine gaining popularity among foreign students,"Tuina has dedicated himself for the past three decades to promoting the 2000-year-old tuina (a form of TCM manipulative therapy) worldwide with his English lectures and therapy demonstrations.Last week, acupuncture anesthesia was successfully applied to three surgeries of coronary angiography at the Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine affiliated to SHUTCM, a precedent of the application of acupuncture anesthesia in this kind of surgery. ""TCM's tuina [traditional Chinese massage] can also take the place of opioid analgesics to produce analgesic effects. It is more effective, more comfortable and more convenient than acupuncture, which requires needles. And it is safer than Western chemical medicine, which may have side-effects,"" Li said. Based on TCM's medical principles which have a history of two millennia, tuina involves using the hand, palm, knuckles and fingers to apply pressure in meridian and acupressure points to remove blockages along meridian points and stimulate specific areas with qi (body's energy flow) to promote healing.It is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, fire cupping, herbalism and qigong (Chinese breathing exercise). The therapy can be traced back to China's primitive period, when people used the techniques to treat accidental injuries caused by natural disasters or animal attacks.  As a form of TCM, the knowledge of tuina is extensive and profound. However, with Li's precise and proficient English explanations and demonstrations, even foreign students can easily understand difficult TCM concepts. Last Thursday, around 20 students from the US attended Li's lecture as a part of their study-abroad trip program. Li introduced several basic skills of the manipulative therapy at the lecture. The students listened to Li with great interest and attentiveness.Every time Li introduced a new skill, he invited a student to come forward to be his model. Although tuina is a practical discipline which requires much practice, it also requires accurate descriptions of the key points of the skill.Hands-on learningKristine Troutman is a nurse practitioner student from Florida, the US. She joined the study-abroad trip organized by the University of South Alabama to learn about Chinese culture and basic TCM knowledge. She wants to integrate traditional Chinese medicine into her practice. ""This was really my first exposure to TCM, so I'm really interested in finding out the basic principles. I found it very fascinating,"" Troutman said. ""I found it very difficult to do the manipulative therapy. But I can definitely see their worth in practice and how they can help."" Rex Berry from the US state of Kentucky is a medical science student from Duquesne University. He thought it would be a good idea to gain knowledge of different kinds of medicine from around the world. ""Seeing different types of practices elsewhere can probably help me in my own practice,"" Berry said. Berry had seen tuina therapies in videos but had never learned them in a classroom. ""The concepts are easy to understand, though it's hard to put them into practice, which takes years. But Li did a good way of simplifying them for us,"" Berry said.Morgan Wimberry from the University of South Alabama also had her first practice of TCM at Li's lecture. She is a healthcare administration major who joined the program to experience different cultures and see how Eastern medicine is practiced compared with Western medicine. ""I really like Professor Li's class. He's good at explaining things. He has some hands-on portions for us where we got to try different things,"" Wimberry said. TCM in EnglishAfter SHUTCM set up an English language acupuncture-moxibustion and tuina major in 2003 to promote TCM overseas, Li, a doctor from Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine affiliated to SHUTCM, was invited to the university to give English lectures.His foreign students include those from short-term study-abroad TCM programs and also long-term foreign students who are furthering their studies at SHUTCM.Zhanar, 26, from Kazakhstan has been studying acupuncture and tuina at SHUTCM for the past five years. She prefers TCM to Western medicine because she thinks TCM uses more natural substances such as herbs. She thinks the biggest difficulty foreign students face when studying TCM is the language. But since Li's lecture is in English, she doesn't find it difficult to understand the concepts. ""To study medicine, you must clearly understand it,"" Zhanar said. Different from many Chinese doctors of Western medication science who studied abroad, Li has given lectures to many foreign students even though he himself never studied abroad.Influenced by his family members - his mother was a medical science professor at the former Shanghai Medical College and his wife is a current English professor from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University - the TCM doctor obtained his bachelor's, master's and doctorial degrees at SHUTCM and is excellent at both medical science and English language skills. Li's English talent was first revealed as early as 1988, when an American patient who could not speak Chinese was seeking treatment at Yueyang Hospital. No other doctor could speak English at that time except Li. Finally, Li interpreted for the patient and the president of the hospital. Since then, more and more foreign patients and guests come to the hospital for treatment or to study. Over the years, Li has demonstrated, taught and promoted tuina therapy in many overseas countries as a TCM doctor or as a teacher. Li once treated a White House doctor with his palm back rolling manipulation when he visited the US. He also treated a high-level executive of an American medication group with his ""one finger"" manipulation. Gaining popularity overseasAs deputy director of manipulative therapy specialty commission of the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies, a non-governmental international academic organization which promotes TCM across the world, Li demonstrates and promotes tuina therapy overseas every two or three years during the World Congress of Chinese Medicine held by the organization.The congress is held in different countries across the world and is attended by people from all over the world who are interested or specialized in TCM. Last year, Li promoted tuina and acupuncture in Dubai, where China's State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine launched its Dubai center of TCM. His treatment was praised by some Dubai officials and their family members. Later this year, he will fly to either Canada or Germany to showcase the effectiveness of the TCM therapy. Veerachai Soottitantawat, 47, is a Chinese-Thai national who is doing his PhD at SHUTCM. He finished his undergraduate program of TCM in Thailand, where he first met Li, who was sent to his university to teach TCM. Inspired by Li, Soottitantawat continued his postgraduate studies at SHUTCM for three years then went back to Thailand to pursue his career.Two years ago, Soottitantawat returned to Shanghai to further his studies at SHUTCM. ""Thailand also has its own massage therapy, but its techniques are different from TCM's tuina,"" Soottitantawat said. Sarah, a German student of Li, who took part in an exchange program in SHUTCM, did a part-time job at her German college mentor's clinic. Once, a patient was not willing to receive surgery for a backache and pains in the lower limb. Since she studied TCM in China, her mentor asked if she could do something for the patient with TCM therapies.Sarah used tuina to relieve the patient's pains. After graduation, her mentor asked her to work at the clinic. ""A few years ago, she wrote to me and wanted to learn tuina for the treatment of cervical spondylosis,"" Li said. ""The cost of surgeries is very expensive in overseas countries. If the problem is not serious, tuina can solve the problem without costing much. This is also why tuina is popular.""Standardized terminology ""Different from Western medicine, which is a chemical, tuina is a physical and natural therapy that is becoming very popular in Western countries,"" said Li, whose effective treatments and demonstrations overseas helped enhance TCM's popularization in overseas countries. Troutman thinks more Americans are gradually accepting TCM. ""So I'm hoping to bring it to the forefront and hope to apply what I learned into my practice,"" Troutman said. ""As China grows stronger, more Chinese culture is being exported. As an indispensable part of Chinese traditional culture, TCM can be used as a starting point to spread Chinese culture,"" Li said. Li thinks the promotion of TCM through tuina is easier than acupuncture because tuina is more easily accepted for its convenience and comfort. ""Many overseas countries and regions demand licenses to practice acupuncture with needles,"" Li said. ""And the comfortable feeling generated by beta-endorphins when receiving tuina treatment also makes the therapy increasingly popular.""""Tuina used to be called anmo (Chinese for massage) in ancient China. But that type of massage is different from what is today conducted at roadside massage parlors. Ancient anmo used to be a part of Chinese medical science.""Tuina is a manipulative therapy for disease treatment and prevention, or health care under the guidance of TCM principles. So the standard name of the therapy should be tuina. Although roadside massages can also offer relaxation, it has no real medical effect."" The popularization of TCM cannot be accomplished without a precise translation. According to Li, there is no standardization commission for the English translation of TCM in China. But over the years, English translations of some TCM terminologies have become fixed, such as yin, yang, qi, qigong and tuina. Li is involved in a project by the World Health Organization to develop a standardized terminology for TCM practices. Li is responsible for the Chinese and English translations of tuina terms.""Public English translators or translators who know only about Western medicine cannot translate TCM into English precisely. Since TCM is a part of Chinese traditional culture, TCM practitioners should first bring forward TCM concepts and translate them into English.""During the translation process, we can discuss this with foreigners. With the internationalization of China, there are more opportunities for TCM practitioners to communicate with foreigners,"" Li added.Li often discusses TCM translation with his wife, who graduated from Shanghai International Studies University and is now teaching English at Fudan.""It is impossible to find a completely equivalent English translation for every TCM concept. Sometimes we have to differentiate some concepts and persist to the Chinese elements. For example, I insist on using the pinyin word for tuina instead of the word 'massage' when translating the traditional Chinese massage.""Foreign students practice traditional Chinese massage.

133,1134.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Death of Chinese actress sparks Chinese medicine row,"Illustration: Lu Ting/GTThe recent death of 26-year-old Chinese actress Xu Ting has sparked heated online debates over the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). After being diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer that destroys one's immune system, in July, the Lost In Macao star opted for TCM such as cupping and acupuncture rather than chemotherapy.On July 24, Xu posted on her Weibo photos of her TCM treatment. ""Every day the doctor pricks my fingers and my back with needles and squeezes my blood out,"" she complained. ""I also have to drink lots of bitter herbal drugs.""Many online users argued that TCM is useless to cure cancer and begged Xu to receive modern Western medical treatment before it was too late, but Xu still insisted on TCM. Her situation worsened until, in mid-August, she finally relented and underwent two weeks of chemotherapy.  But by then her cancer was late-stage and, on September 7, she passed away.Since her high-profile death, online users have been debating whether the TCM methods Xu used aggravated her cancer and whether she might have lived had she opted for Western medicine from the very beginning. One Weibo user commented that no existing TCM methods have been proven effective for curing cancer. ""It is insane to use cupping or scraping to treat cancer,"" the blogger added.But others argued that TCM should not be blamed for Xu's death because, at her late stage, neither Western nor Chinese medicine could have possibly saved her. ""Lymphoma is the most incurable type of cancers. Only 59 percent of patients with early-stage lymphoma can extend their life for about five years through chemotherapy,"" one netizen said. ""Chemo would only waste her family lots of money and cause her physical torture.""The effectiveness of TCM in treating small sicknesses like colds, flu, stomachaches and cuts is well known and oft-practiced in Chinese households. TCM is also popular among young Chinese adult females to relieve dysmenorrhoea (menstruation cramps). In these instances, most Chinese usually opt for TCM over Western-brand medications or antibiotics.But when it comes to life-threatening illnesses, TCM should never replace Western medical treatment, as there are no medically verified cases of TCM eliminating cancer or AIDS. On the contrary, there are numerous reports of TCM patients dying because they waited too long to properly treat their illnesses.In 2015, a woman from Sichuan Province used TCM to try to cure her early stage breast cancer. According to media reports, she visited many TCM doctors all over the country, adopting various methods like moxibustion (burning dried mugwort on the body) and herbal remedies.Her breast tumor persisted until her TCM doctors threw up their hands and said there was nothing else to do but receive chemo. But by then her cancer cells had already spread to other organs. She died.Why would these patients and their families shun proven Western medical treatment for old-fashioned Chinese methods? One reason is the price issue. Online statistics show that, in China, just one session of chemotherapy costs between 3,000 yuan ($449.73) and 7,000 yuan. Usually dozens of sessions are required.In contrast, cupping and acupuncture are only hundreds of yuan per session. For patients from poor economic backgrounds, receiving Western medical treatment could put them in debt for life.Additionally, cancer patients are petrified of the pain and side effects (like vomiting) of chemo. Actress Xu said that she had a friend who died after experiencing the unbearable agony of radiology.""I am not sure whether TCM can cure my cancer but chemotherapy treatment is extremely painful and could even make me die faster,"" she wrote in a blog post while still alive.Some online skeptics pointed out that Xu's decision was also motivated by vanity. As someone who heavily relied on her looks for her profession and had allegedly undergone facial reconstruction surgery, Xu might have been horrified about losing all her hair in chemo. ""I don't want to let chemotherapy torment me to the point where there's no beauty left,"" she wrote.Sadly, now there's no Xu Ting left either, another strike against TCM and their doctors and another example why Chinese hospitals should make antibiotics and Western medical methods more affordable and more well-known to patients in need.The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Global Times.http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/57/147502234907.jpeg"
134,1135.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Healing the qi,"A foreign TCM doctor performs cupping therapy on a patient. More and more foreigners are heading to China to learn and practice TCM. Photo: CFPLighting cotton balls in glass cups to create a vacuum and then putting them on the back of the prostrate patient one by one, the doctor's hands move quickly and with surety. He is administering cupping therapy, which would be an ordinary scene in clinics all around China, except that this particular doctor is a foreigner.Cupping therapy is not new to doctor Igor Micunovic. In fact, the 38-year-old Montenegrin, who is currently doing a clinical internship at the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine routinely administers cupping therapy to patients. In his independent clinical practice, he has seen various responses to cupping therapy, especially from Western patients.""Oh, how long are the bruises going to last? I don't dare go sunbathing; people would think I am a victim of domestic violence,"" said one patient, who was accompanied by her husband.  ""Well, just one to two years. Later the skin will peel off and revitalize itself over time,"" said Micunovic jokingly to the visibly shocked couple. ""I'm just joking; they might last several days or up to a week,"" he said, finally putting them at ease.As the West wakes up to cupping therapy, bruising remains a major concern: spouses and parents of patients fear being accused of abuse.A particularly serious incident happened in his hometown of Montenegro. The mother of his 6-year-old patient was accused of child abuse when she took her daughter to get vaccinated, and someone noticed her bruises. A hospital official had to call Micunovic to prove the mother's innocence. Cupping therapy bruises propelled the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy technique onto the world stage recently when highly decorated American Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps sported them shortly after winning gold at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in Brazil. Western media and social networks went wild with curiosity.""What Are the Purple Dots on Michael Phelps? Cupping Has an Olympic Moment,"" said the headline of a New York Time blog on August 8. The post was accompanied by a 41 second video clip explaining why Olympians are turning to cupping therapy.Phelps posted photos of himself during cupping therapy online. In an August 13 interview with CCTV, Phelps disclosed that he has been doing cupping for two or three years, and it is effective for him.Coming to China in 2001, Micunovic is one of the growing number of foreigners who are learning and practicing TCM, eager to promote it to the world. This group of foreigners are delighted that more people around the world are becoming familiar with TCM through the athletes at the Rio Olympics and are hopeful that there will be fewer misunderstandings about the medical practice. For love of TCMIt was the efficacy of cupping in sports medicine that first attracted Micunovic. According to him, cupping promotes faster rehabilitation and gets rid of pain after a competition by improving the flow of qi (vital internal energy).Micunovic came across TCM while reading for his master's degree in medicine at the University of Kragujevac in Serbia in 2000. Minoring in sports medicine at the time, Micunovic was instantly intrigued by TCM's rehabilitative properties when he came across it in a book. ""I was greatly inspired. I was an athlete myself, and I hoped to find more medical tools for faster rehabilitation and better sports performance,"" said Micunovic. He was so taken by the subject that he left the University of Kragujevac and enrolled in Tianjin University of TCM. Micunovic's passion for TCM grew even further when he injured his foot during his first year in China. He tried several modern Western treatments, but they didn't work, and his X-rays revealed nothing even though he was still suffering. Then he tried acupuncture, and after his first attempt, his pain was gone. The doctor who performed acupuncture on him later became his tutor and mentor.Through his study of TCM and his own experience, Micunovic has achieved a deep understanding of TCM and its difference from Western medicine.""Chinese medicine treats the human body as a unit and search for the disease's root and manifestations, but modern [Western] medicine treats only symptoms,"" he said. ""A TCM doctor's diagnosis might predict and treat diseases at the very beginning, while modern [Western] medicine often finds sickness in a late phase."" Not everyone has a chance to gain an in-depth understanding of TCM like Micunovic. Even though TCM is gaining popularity overseas, it is not yet mainstream and people have varying understandings of what it is and how it works. Some are extremely skeptical, and they regard TCM as unscientific, a kind of folk medicine or even witchcraft.But even as some Westerners denigrate TCM, other more pragmatic foreigners flock to it. People might be surprised by the overnight sensation of cupping therapy due to the Rio Olympics. But the fact that more and more foreign doctors have been heading to China to learn and practice TCM is a more powerful evidence of the influence and popularity of TCM, said Micunovic.Igor Micunovic performs acupuncture on a patient at his clinic in Montenegro. Photo: Courtesy of Igor MicunovicForeign TCM doctors in ChinaA foreigner who practices TCM is still quite novel in China. Kwak Hyeong-seok is a 36-year-old Korean doctor who works at the Beijing Dongwen TCM Clinic. Kwak moved to China in 2004 to study at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine.According to Kwak, people may think that it is more common for a Korean to learn TCM in China than a Westerner who is less familiar with TCM. But they are wrong.""The truth is that it takes maybe more courage for people like me because the TCM license is not recognized in Korea, which means that [from the start] I decided never go back,"" he said.Kwak was attracted by TCM's efficiency in curing chronic diseases compared with Western medicine. He developed a strong faith in TCM after his brother's chronic rhinitis was cured using TCM.His work in China is not without its challenges though. Even as an Asian, he too has to overcome certain traditional perceptions about doctors.""I don't really have advantages when it comes to Chinese patients, because many Chinese prefer a local one,"" he said.While not much of a favorite among the Chinese, doctors like Kwak are comparatively more popular among foreigners, especially those who share the same or a similar culture and language.As a Korean doctor, Kwak is more attractive to patients from Korea and Japan. Kwak thinks his advantage over local TCM doctors lies in his being a foreigner who understands the different cultural backgrounds and has resonance with foreigners. This is important because people may think that TCM is the same throughout East Asia when the truth is that TCM is localized according to the different natural environments and physiques. ""Chinese patients prefer a strong sensation during acupuncture, while Japanese and Koreans are more sensitive and prefer more tender treatment because in Korea and Japan, the needles they use are thinner,"" he said. His understanding of the difference helps him better treat his patients.Promoting TCM overseasForeign doctors who study TCM have multiple career options. Some, like Kwak, might opt to build their career and family in China, whereas others, like Micunovic, may want to return home.According to Micunovic, TCM clinics date back decades in the US. He said former US President Richard Nixon introduced the technique after a visit to China, during which he was amazed by TCM.However, the majority of the clinics in the West are irregular and run by people without proper training or even certification, he said. The stigmatization of TCM as unscientific folk medicine, massage therapy, or even witchcraft abroad has posed problems for the promotion of legitimate TCM practices.""It took me nearly three years to notarize my bachelor and PhD diplomas from Tianjin University of TCM in Montenegro,"" said Micunovic. According to Micunovic, the promotion of TCM can only be gained by removing misconceptions about TCM in the West through education and proper regulations. This is why he is determined to get his TCM license in China and later cooperate with the local health authority back home. Micunovic also thinks doctors should practice what they preach and show the health benefits of a TCM lifestyle by living it. He is not only a TCM doctor but also a practitioner. According to him, the aim of TCM is to keep relative balance - inside and out, meaning within one's body as well as the environment. As an athlete, Micunovic gradually gave up strenuous exercise and learned qigong and tai chi. In accordance with TCM theory, he watches what he eats and tries not to waste energy but to accumulate it. By doing these, he aims to dispel misunderstandings and distrust toward TCM. ""In Chinese medicine, the basic principles are not to try to convince others but to show your results and prove to others,"" he said."

Some of them had reportedly praised cupping as the best therapy they'd ever had.Regular cupping therapy involves suction created by using heat or mechanical pumps to make the glass cups stick to the skin.Usually, a TCM doctor would perform the therapy on a patient by lighting cotton balls in glass cups to create a vacuum and then putting the cups on the patient's shoulders and back one by one. A treatment usually lasts between 10 and 20 minutes.Although this treatment is now gaining popularity all over the world it has been a long-favored treatment in Shanghai with hundreds (if not thousands) of people lining up at local hospitals and clinics for cupping.The 26-year-old Yuan Jie is one of these cupping enthusiasts.  ""My whole body feels relaxed after the treatment,""Yuan told the Global Times. He has been using the therapy for quite a long time.Another local resident surnamed Zhao said he had found cupping was a good way to treat eczema.""Everyone has eczema inside their body. So getting it out of your body is beneficial to your health,""Zhao explained.Cupping therapy can also help ease body pain.Mr Wang who is a sedentary worker, used to suffer from neck and low back pain. He finally found pain relief in cupping after a friend had recommended this for him.""I tried it a couple of times and my neck pain and back pain gradually lessened,""Wang said.""That's how I fell in love with cupping therapy.""Not only have local residents appreciated this long-standing TCM treatment, but many expats inShanghaihave also tried the method over the past few years.Wu Yaochi is a doctor with the TCM department of Shanghai's Sixth People's Hospital. He told the Global Times there were a growing number of the city's younger people using cupping therapy these days.""As today's young people tend to adopt a less active lifestyle than the older generation, more and more young people are developing illnesses such aslumbar intervertebral disc protrusionand shoulder periarthritis. But cupping therapy can help ease the pain and treat these problems,""Wu said.A man has cupping therapy at Shanghai's Sixth People's Hospital.Doctors with Shanghai's Sixth People's Hospital administer cupping therapy to patients.

He believes that science teachers are not a good fit for teaching TCM. Yang also pointed out that, though having a lot in common with science, TCM and science are simply not the same.In fact, many TCM beliefs directly contradict proven scientific theories. ""For instance,"" Yang observed, ""some TCM experts claim that humans may invigorate their organs by ingesting respective animals organs. 'A kidney for a kidney,' for example, which means eating an animal kidney nourishes one's own. How ridiculous does that sound to the science teachers!"" Yang is not alone in feeling unsure about his newly assigned role as a TCM teacher. Shi Youhe, Director of Teaching and Researching at Lin'an Chenxi Elementary School, shares Yang's concern.

However, till this point, I have not even had complete faith in TCM myself. I believe that the first step is to make myself interested in this subject, but unfortunately, the training only lasted one day.""Shi expressed his disappointment but said he would nonetheless faithfully perform the tasks.Read, think, learn, practiceShi shared an example of his frustration. There are nine chapters in the textbook TCMW, which is the equivalent of 36 class hours. Each class hour consists of four modules: ""Read,"" ""Think,"" ""Learn"" and ""Practice.""Every lesson begins with a well-known story from ancient China, followed by a learning point and then an extended practice session. For example, Lesson 1, ""Shennong (an ancient Chinese chief known as Yandi) Discovering Curative Virtues of Plants,"" showcases the process of Chinese ancestors discovering herbal medicine.The story is followed by the introduction of the homologous nature of medicine and food. In the practice module, students are asked to ""taste the following foods that have curative properties,"" and ""decide whether they taste the same as described in the traditional Chinese medical literature.""Shi was at a loss upon reading this question. Admittedly, introducing TCM theories with stories should be appealing to children. However, without any reference books for the teachers to prepare for the class, their job is made difficult. ""Does that mean I will have to buy some Chinese medicine to try for myself?"" Shi wondered.He also feels that the development stage of this course was too rushed. ""The textbook is written in a hasty manner. I think they need to realize that a lot of TCM theories that the experts take for granted are difficult for us laymen."" said Shi.Yang shares his view. He pointed out that the TCM course did not go through an experimental stage like science classes during the curriculum reform. ""Having written the textbook doesn't mean the course is ready to be taught in the classroom. There should be an experimental stage before it is offered to the public. They should have picked at least one school for a test run.""The ""curriculum reform"" Yang referred to is the National Science Curriculum Reform for the Compulsory Elementary Education, which is currently occurring simultaneously with the promotion of the TCM course. The new science curriculum criterion will replace the 2001 version.According to Liu Enshan, chair of the Revision Committee of Compulsory Education Elementary Science Curriculum Standards, the development of the new curriculum standards took over five years. The early stage involved status quo research, document analysis, International comparison, monographic study, design demonstration and preliminary exploration of teaching strategies.After the completion of the first draft, several large-scale surveys were carried out targeting eastern and western regions of China, which were then followed by repeated revisions of the draft.The TCM course does not appear to have any official standard. An official course standard specifies the nature and concept of a discipline, course objectives, course content, as well as implementation recommendations etc. As far as Yang is concerned, before a course is offered to the public there must be a standard, however TCM textbooks seem to be the only thing it offers. Popular skepticismGao Yinming is a mother of a fifth grader. She keeps an open mind and is hopeful that her daughter will learn something new. But Gao knows a parent who is a doctor trained in Western medicine. He is one of those who are against introducing TCM in the classroom.It is of vital importance to cultivate scientific literacy in our children, but traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine or Miao (one of the ethnic minorities in China) medicine hardly do anything to contribute to it, the doctor said.In fact, for a long time, TCM's scientific quality and value system have been subject to controversy. One parent from Shaoxing is openly opposing teaching children TCM at school. He is concerned that this course may cause a discrepancy between what is taught in class and what is learned at home.This concern is shared by many other parents as well as science teachers, such as Yang, who wonders what to do when a TCM course contradicts science.Parents like Gao who are more supportive on this matter also have their concerns. TCM teachers, they say, have only attended temporary training. Being amateurs themselves, are they really suitable to teach?Moreover, TMC as an area of study is extensive and profound. Though the TCM course aims only to touch upon the basics, it can be misleading to children, as their comprehensive and interpretive abilities are not fully developed yet.Thirdly, some TCM theories tend to be ambiguous or vague. While adults may form a correct understanding, children tend to take things literally. As someone suggested online, ""why not offer children a first-aid course or sex education instead of TCMW?""Fang Jianqiao, President of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (ZCMU), believes that elementary school students are not old enough yet to take any of these courses, including and especially sex education. Fang explained that because children are naturally inquisitive, with easy access to information nowadays, introducing these concepts too early might encourage them to try it themselves..The goalOn April 8, Zhejiang Province released the first series of elementary school TCM textbooks in the country. Xu Weiwei, director of Zhejiang administration of TCM, has been envisioning this day for over two years.He believes that to popularize TCM, it is important to promote wider acceptance of TCM among the next generation. To accept something, Xu explains, the first step is to get to know it.In 2016, Xu officially submitted a project proposal to the provincial department of education, along with a funding request to the department of finance. His proposal was met with enthusiasm.Zhejiang department of finance sponsors this project with an annual fund of 5-6 million yuan.Xu ascribed the successful approval of the project to the rich TCM culture in Zhejiang. The province had 94 State-owned TCM hospitals as of 2015, generating an annual number of TCM hospital visits that ranks first in the country.In January 2016, the idea of introducing TCM to children at school was brought up and discussed at the National People's Congress.On February 26, the State Council released a national ""Strategic Plan for the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2016-2030). In October 2015, Tu Youyou, Chinese pharmaceutical chemist and educator, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering artemisinin in qinghao (wormwood herb), proving the efficacy of TCM and boosting national enthusiasm to it. Xu believes that all those above have contributed to the birth of this project.This project does not lack in supporters. Zhao Min, professor of Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, believes that TCM is an important part of Chinese culture, ""teaching our youth TCM helps to boost their national confidence and cultural pride.""In response to parents' concerns on the obscurity of TCM and the feasibility of the project, Xu explained, ""this course does not aim to teach methods of treatment, but rather a way of life. It aims to promote TCM philosophy, to show our children that man is an integral part of nature.""To address some of the teachers' concerns about their competence to teach this course, Xu said local TCM practitioners will be sent for the training of teachers.China Newsweek - Global Timeshttp://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/73/150759611242.jpeghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/47/150759612256.jpeg"

141,1142.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Expats suffering from Shanghai stress should give TCM a try,"Illustration: Chen Xia/GTIf there is one undervalued element of China's encouragement of soft power and cultural exports, it's traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its various therapeutic offshoots.Living in a big-city environment such as Shanghai, we are all subject to additional toxins, pollutants and particulate matter as well as stress brought on by our busy lifestyles and work schedules. But what to do about it?TCM is currently enjoying its moment on the world stage following headlines coming out of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games about the health practices of certain elite-level athletes. Athletes, the most superstitious of creatures when it comes to health and fitness, are usually early-adopters of any health-related therapies that could give them a slight edge over their equally health-conscious opponents.When Michael Phelps whipped off his tracksuit to reveal his cupping bruises, it caused a sensation across the world.  Adopting holistic therapies, acupuncture and other TCM are not exactly new to high-level sports.However, cupping is a mystery to anyone not of Chinese heritage and thus resulted in a million dollars worth of free press not just for Phelps but the TCM industry. Immediately the Internet was abuzz with gossip and speculation regarding this little-known, hazily understood practice.The resulting publicity is a golden opportunity for TCM to make headway as a recognized beneficial medical treatment that can have very positive and life-improving benefits for a worldwide population.But in fact, TCM has long been embraced by the medical community outside China. Most progressive practitioners of Western medicine view TCM as a valuable complement to other treatments and as a preventative weapon in their arsenal of remedies against disease and internal ailments.The history of trial and error that has been the growth tree of TCM differs somewhat from the scientific method used for Western patent medicinal studies, but the end result is a valuable log of information and cures analogous to traditional Western remedies that were discovered in much the same way.For expats in China, language and a fear of the unknown are significant barriers to experimentation with TCM. Even many of my younger Chinese colleagues view TCM as a quaint or outdated folk practice that they are reluctant to pursue and bemusedly listen to the results of my TCM trials with ground-ant teas or sea polyp skeleton powders.My very first visit to a TCM doctor was with a tremendously busy doctor, a legendary practitioner in Shanghai, who has patients travel to see him from all over China and overseas.Nonetheless, he interviewed me thoroughly, asking questions far in excess of what most time-pressed doctors in my home country would have time for. Finally, after consulting his charts and tables he wrote out a prescription with detailed instructions.""Don't worry!"" he assured me. ""After a couple of weeks sticking to the schedule, if you follow the directions you will regain almost all of your previous energy and vitality. After all,"" he intoned, ""there isn't really much seriously wrong with you other than that you are getting old.""A few hours later, a ringing of my doorbell announced the arrival of a courier bringing me my freshly brewed batch of medicine.A large 5-kg plastic sack containing 60 smaller bags of a thick brown, unctuous liquid, each marked with the red seal of a prancing deer on the flap and steaming with a high heat, having just been poured from the medicine brew-pot.Needless to say, each dose tasted terrible and was taken with a certain amount of complaining and grumbling.The thing is - it works! Unlike Western medicine that cannot be taken until a disease presents itself, TCM protocol is to anticipate ailments and correct problems that can lead to adverse health outcomes without using invasive techniques.It's not always able to prescribe a magic bullet, but there is a complementary and beneficial aspect to the treatment that we can all use while trying to stay healthy in this stressful and polluted environment.The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Global Times.http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/7/148150858599.jpeg"

However, their plan is being criticized by those who say China shouldn't forcefully push for the development of TCM until it's been tested by modern science.A TCM practitioner prepares to perform acupuncture on a patient. Photo: IC After rushing to a hospital to visit 22 children who had just been in a terrible car accident, Liu Weizhong immediately suggested the nurse give the children pig's feet soup to drink, especially the one who was still in coma. The nurse, who did not recognize Liu, director of the Gansu provincial Department of Health, said that the child is in gastric dilatation and should fast for four to five days. The director of the hospital told her to do what Liu said.Later the child in the coma woke up and began to eat. Pig feet's soup then became a famous dish in Gansu, as people decided that the soup was the deciding factor in the children's recovery. Liu was ironically referred to by netizens as the ""pig feet director.""Recalling the 2011 incident, Liu, 58, told the Southern Weekly that he was taking a big risk. ""What if the child died?"" he said.During his eight years with the Department of Health, he has always been in the center of controversies as he fervently promotes TCM not only in the province but also on his social media accounts, angering many medical professionals who doubt the efficacy of TCM.While he is under fire, on April 11, Liu attended the monthly news conference of National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), where he touted Gansu's healthcare reform. As the NHFPC rarely allows a province to boast of its achievements at this kind of conference, some analysts speculated that the commission was implicitly endorsing Gansu's pro-TCM measures.However, it's still being debated whether TCM should be pushed by the government, because there are still some controversies about whether it's a legitimate form of therapy.A staff member dispenses TCM herbal drinks to elderly people in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. Photo: ICRadical reformWhen Liu started work at the Gansu provincial Department of Health in 2008, he worried so much about Gansu's medical reform when he looked at its barren mountains. ""Gansu is a poor province. So we have to use cheap methods,"" he said. According to local statistics from 2007, in that year 70 percent of Gansu patients who needed hospitalization did not get any hospital treatment due to a shortage of funding.""We don't have money, technology and there are too many patients. How can we reform our system?"" said Liu.After careful consideration, he decided to promote TCM. The reasons are simple according to him: the medicines are cheap, people accept TCM, and he believes TCM can both treat and prevent diseases.Pioneering reform to push TCM officially kicked off in Gansu in 2009. The province announced that locals would receive free TCM diagnoses and treatment and released dozens of policies to develop TCM.The Gansu health department employed a propagandist for each village. These young people not only explained the policy to the locals but also painted walls with TCM factoids. So far, they have painted 71,322 walls. The health department also gave 4.8 million urban and suburban households TCM packages containing thermometers, scraping plates, cupping devices and other items. Liu required the province's comprehensive first-class hospitals which at the time mostly offered Western medicine to establish TCM departments as well as TCM pharmacies. He ordered that at least 5 percent of their beds be made available for TCM patients.At the beginning, Liu's policy was strongly opposed by the Gansu Provincial Cancer Hospital (GPCH). The doctors said that cancer patients need to go through surgery and radiotherapy. To them, TCM is just an accessory to proven Western treatments.Liu later changed the head of the GPCH, and many doctors in the hospital left. ""More than 20 experts quit,"" he said.In the interview with Southern Weekly, Liu said that now the GPCH has become a role model in promoting TCM. In the cancer hospital, TCM prescriptions are everywhere. In the wards, massage, acupuncture and foot baths are given to cancer patients.Liu decided that grass-roots doctors need no medical education background to practice TCM. Now there are 27,235 TCM practitioners in Gansu.Making achievementNow the average per capita medical costs in Gansu are the lowest in China. Liu boasted that at a time when medical costs in the country are going up, Gansu's are decreasing.After the reform, the average cost of hospital treatment in the GPCH decreased by 4,000 yuan ($618).In terms of curbing the overuse of antibiotics - which can lead to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant viruses and are expensive - He Jing, an obstetrician who has been working in Gansu for 30 years, said that Gansu has been more effective at this task than other provinces. In Gansu, doctors can only prescribe two shots of antibiotics for a caesarian. For minor operations, the use of antibiotics is forbidden. ""In other places, they only use those expensive medicines,"" said He.Liu said Gansu heavily punishes the overuse of antibiotics. ""In five years, we've punished about 5,000 doctors. Some were demoted and it was noted on some of their records that they had performed poorly,"" he said.To ensure the hospitals get their patients to use TCM, quotas have been set. In the province's comprehensive hospitals, the TCM participation rate for patients should reach 80 percent, 90 percent for those suffering from serious diseases. TCM should make up at least 20 percent of total expenses.A local citizen surnamed Sun told the Global Times that in underdeveloped regions like Gansu, people trust TCM more - especially when it comes to treating the elderly.But she said that the promotion of TCM should not become extreme. ""Choosing either TCM or Western medicines should depend on the illness you have,"" she said. According to the timetable provided by the State Council, the country will establish a ""hierarchical"" medical system by 2020, in which different problems are treated at different medical institutions to reduce pressure on the countries' higher-level medical institutions. But Liu decided to accomplish it by 2017.In Gansu, only 49 out of 350 diseases covered by medical insurance policies can be treated at the first-class hospitals. Patients who go to the hospitals with other problems must pay for their treatment.After implementing the policy in February, some comprehensive hospitals in Gansu's capital Lanzhou have seen empty beds for the first time. While county-level hospitals are packed.Medical experts in big hospitals need to go to rural hospitals to assist staff there for at least six days every season.However, Li Qingfeng, 30, said that after spending one year in a county-level hospital, he felt such reform was not as effective as hoped. The only memory of his time there is of the long commute back and forth. ""It's like I'm taking a break. The rural environment is good,"" he said.Controversy remainsThe effectiveness of TCM has always been a topic of fierce discussion. Many Western medicine doctors argue that as TCM treatments are not subject to the rigors of peer-reviewed studies, they are not reliable and may even be harmful. Yao Jia, from East China's Jiangsu Province, said she spends much of her time correcting friends and relatives' ""false"" belief in ""traditional prescriptions,"" such as drinking herbal tea to cure sickness or eating donkey skin to increase their blood level. ""Besides, I've read reports about how some herbal medicines can be poisonous and harmful to health,"" she said. ""Unless the medicine goes through scientific tests using modern methods, I'm not going to trust it."" The total output value of the TCM industry reached more than 730 billion yuan in 2014, making up one third of the total value of the medical industry, according to a 2016 Xinhua News Agency report. Wang Guoqiang, director of the State Administration of TCM said that in the past five years, 500 TCM hospitals have been opened, and 91.2 percent of community health serve centers now provide TCM services. The country is also about to pass its first TCM law.In recent years, many provinces across China have started to include TCM into their public medical insurance programs, such as reimbursing the costs of acupuncture, and herbal medicine. At the end of last year, a TCM law was drafted and submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review. The draft regulates TCM, as well as makes suggestions on how to improve TCM. But many experts questioned it on the base of whether TCM is a legitimate science. Global Times - Agencies"

It has given me many memories.I'm one of those incorrigible guys who are always eager to experiment with anything new. This bug made me leave my lucrative job, home and family to come all the way to China.A lady colleague mentioned that she goes to a hospital for acupuncture, and that it really helped her.  I never dared to ask her medical problem. When I told her about my mild insomnia, she suggested I try it out.She was kind enough to fix an appointment with the doctor after waiting in a long queue for many hours. It turned out to be a famous Traditional Chinese Medicine hospital. I was amazed to see that the whole place busy and crowded.Since the doctor did not know English, my colleague translated my problem to him. He felt my pulse and advised a few sessions of acupuncture.This treatment was not cheap by any means but I decided to give it a try. It started with a head massage, which is always relaxing. Then I was ushered to another room. The doctor took out more than a dozen needles from his white coat pocket and started piercing them softly at different points on my body. I was asked not to move at all.It slowly made me uncomfortable, and I longed for my doctor to remove the needles.Thankfully my maiden experience with acupuncture ended. That night I slept well. The effect, however, gradually started fading.I went through another three sessions. By this time the drill was quite familiar and I did not need my colleague.For my last session, the doctor wanted to try something new. A young trainee female doctor told me in broken English to remove my shirt. Something like a ""hot pot"" was placed on my navel. The doctor told me to call her if I felt uncomfortable.I was very happy that I was being treated for problems with my stomach. It is my belief that the stomach is the source of all health problems. Initially I felt nice. But slowly I started feeling the heat. I tolerated it, thinking this was the point.At one point it became almost unbearable. I could not move, otherwise the burning pot would spill all over me. I looked around for the doctor. She had disappeared.Finally she came and removed the pot. The skin of my stomach had burned. There was a big boil in the middle of my stomach. The doctor, instead of being apologetic for neglecting me, started blaming me for not calling her.I had to start a new treatment. The boil had to be surgically removed before it became an ulcer.I have a permanent mark in the middle of my stomach. It is my new identification mark, in case I get lost in a crowded place.

[Photo provided to China Daily]Traditional Chinese medicine is enjoying a renaissance. But there is growing skepticism about the efficacy of its methods from within its own ranks. Dr Heiner Fruehauf, who claims to have cured himself of cancer using ancient healing methods, shares his views with Matt Hodges in Shanghai.The real threat to traditional Chinese medicine is not fear relating to its use of toxic compounds, but growing skepticism about the efficacy of its methods from within its own ranks, according to a leading German practitioner of the ancient medical system. This is leading to a dangerous form of cross-pollination that is divorcing TCM from its holistic roots and seeing classical practices become forgotten, says Dr Heiner Fruehauf, who claims to have cured himself of cancer using ancient healing methods.""One of the biggest problems today is that many doctors teach traditional Chinese medicine, but they don't fully believe in it,"" says Fruehauf, founding professor of the School of Classical Chinese Medicine at the National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon in the United States.""We've reached an end stage, where the real Chinese medicine that is a science in its own right is slowly disappearing, and where we have some kind of hybrid,"" he adds. ""The modern version we have today is really a combination of Western medicine and TCM.""""I was also skeptical at first, and used to mix both myself,"" admits Fruehauf, who was speaking at a forum hosted by Three on the Bund in Shanghai in early September.Such thinking has led to a spike in herbal-remedy prescriptions that contain similar ingredients to those clinically proven by Western medicine. By the same token, ancient practices such as Taoist alchemy, pulse diagnosis and qigong - all of which Fruehauf specializes in - are falling by the wayside.He later became convinced that TCM can be used to successfully cure serious diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease by drawing on classical precepts. These can be found in ancient texts like the Yellow Emperor's Inner Cannon - a de facto road map for TCM - and I Ching, an even older text that draws on cosmology and divination.""There are so many different ways of treating diseases and ailments - through fasting, through visualization, through things that you could only explain as magic through a modern perspective. There are hundreds of these forgotten methods that people in the villages and mountains still know, but which are not being taught anymore,"" he says.Tibetan herbs enrich local people Patients' health in her hands Use of medicinal herbs is one of the key elements of China's ancient medical system. [Photo provided to China Daily]Good medicine?In some ways, TCM is enjoying a renaissance. The number of its practitioners continues to spike, acupuncture remains trendy, and Chinese lawmakers recently called for its more widespread use in controlling infectious diseases like SARS and Avian Influenza.Citing government statistics, Xinhua reported recently that H7N9-virus patients had a mortality rate of 9.1 percent if treated with a combination of TCM and Western methods. This rate deteriorated to 30 percent for those depending solely on the latter.More positive PR came from Tu Youyou, a scientist from Zhejiang province. In 2011 she was awarded for her work in isolating artemisinin decades earlier from sweet wormwood, a popular Chinese medicinal herb. This compound later became the key ingredient in the world's leading anti-malaria drug.Despite these achievements, Fruehauf says it is debatable whether TCM is enjoying a new golden age.""If you ask the Chinese government and the American Association of Chinese Medicine, they think it's on the rise. It's getting better every day,"" he says.""But while we probably have more licensed Chinese medicine practitioners in China, as well as in the West, than ever before, the quality of those people is lower than ever before. So that's what I'm worried about.""Part of the problem stems from a brain drain as talented students chase more lucrative jobs in the legal professions or in big corporations, and part of it is cultural.""It's a reality that (the vast majority) of students at a Chinese medicine school, in China especially, don't want to be there. They just didn't pass the exam for the regular medicine school. So, right from the get-go, they're not that interested,"" he says. ""Most of them, five years later, make their money from prescribing antibiotics and other Western medicines.""True believerFruehauf, a renowned Sinologist, was born in Germany to a family of medical doctors but has called the US home for much of the past 20 years. He spent two years studying at Shanghai's Fudan University before gaining his doctorate from the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago.He was later diagnosed with cancer, which led him to decline a faculty position at Harvard and return to China for the specific purpose of studying Chinese medicine in Chengdu.He had surgery to remove a tumor but declined to undergo chemotherapy to eradicate the disease and claimed to have found success through TCM methods instead.Since then, he has spent about one month each year bringing groups of 20 to 30 people to secluded mountain monasteries and retreats in exotic locations like Sichuan and Yunnan provinces to practice tai chi, qigong and other forms of spiritual cultivation with his Chinese teachers.TCM has come under fire in recent years for its use of toxic herbs that can harm people's health, prompting calls from overseas for greater regulation of the industry. Chinese government began addressing the issue in July by launching a national crackdown on all counterfeit medicines, including those used by TCM doctors.But Fruehauf sees the media furor as part of a backlash by Western interest groups aimed at constraining the influence at TCM.""Of course, it's possible that some people can get liver damage from herbs that are heavy-metal polluted, or herbs that are mis-prescribed. But in comparison to how many tens of thousands of people get liver toxicity from Western medicine, there's just no comparison.""Drawing a key distinction with Western medicine, he says the most important thing about TCM is self-empowerment.""Our job is really to educate people to empower themselves, so they don't need us,"" he says.""Of course, as a Chinese medicine practitioner, I'm biased. I think that Chinese medicine has something that's much older than Western naturopathic medicine, and has a much more sophisticated theory behind it.""Tibetan herbs enrich local people Patients' health in her hands "

""It can hurt a little, but the pain does not stay, it takes maybe a few seconds then it goes away,"" Donnersmarck told Xinhua on Friday at an acupuncture clinic.Donnersmarck has been coming to the Beijing Chinese Medical Center in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, every week for three months.This 44-year-old German director is best known for his thriller ""The Lives of Others,"" which won the Best Foreign Language Film Award at the 79th Oscars in 2007.Years of working hard in the movie industry caused Donnersmarck neck pains, and it got serious in February when the doctor told him he needed surgery. Then a nurse suggested him to try Traditional Chinese medicine and to see Dr. Wu Baolin at the Beijing Chinese Medical Center.As a recognized authority on Traditional Chinese medicine with a degree in Western medicine, Dr. Wu has been practicing in Santa Monica for 27 years.Donnersmarck admitted that it was scary when he saw the acupuncture needles for the first time. ""Acupuncture is a very precise, careful and caring process... the doctor can not miss by a few millimeters,"" he told Xinhua, ""With Dr. Wu, you feel so much the deep wisdom, the experience, the knowledge. I feel it so much and I trust him.""His trust paid him back. Without any surgery, Donnersmarck's problem was solved in one month. ""I found that Western medicine can be very aggressive, and it has extreme side effects,"" Donnersmarck said. ""But for Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, they do not have side effects, it is about activating the energy and oxygen flow in the body, it is about helping the body heal itself.""Another thing that Donnersmarck found impressive was how Dr. Wu takes Western medicine into consideration and uses that in Traditional Chinese medicine.""He is not against Western medicine, there are specific cases where he says this is better looked by Western doctors,"" Donnersmarck said when he took his family members to see Dr. Wu, who would look carefully at the diagnosis made by Western doctors.

""More people start to understand that Chinese medicine and Western medicine should be brought together.

Zhai Xiaofeng, the TCM clinic doctor of the Peace Ark hospital, explained the basics of TCM to 18 visitors.TCM focuses on the human body as a whole system, while Western medicine focuses more on each specific part of the human body, Zhai said, triggering questions from curious visitors.Zhai explained the cause of bloodshot eyes using the TCM theory when Lorry Riebel, from the US Navy hospital ship Mercy, tried to understand which of the five elements in TCM theory - metal, wood, water, fire and earth - eyes belong.The exchange reached its climax when Fu Bensheng, a TCM doctor on Peace Ark, displayed the Chinese massage and cupping therapies.""I just experienced the cupping therapy.

152,1153.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Is cupping therapy good for you?,"Cupping is a form of therapy widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It consists of creating a local suction on the skin using either heat (fire) or mechanical devices (hand or electrical pumps).Round brown marks left by the traditional Chinese cupping treatment are seen on the body of American Olympic champion Michael Phelps. [Photo/Sina Weibo] There was a gasp of surprise at the Rio Olympic Games when American swimmer Michael Phelps won his 19th and20thOlympic gold medal and helped his team win the 4x100 meters freestyle relay. And the surprise was not only for his remarkable achievement but also for some dark purple circles on his shoulders and back. They were the result of having undergone ""cupping"" before the race.Cupping is a form of therapy widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It consists of creating a local suction on the skin using either heat (fire) or mechanical devices (hand or electrical pumps). It is believed this method draws out toxins, mobilizes blood flow, soothes muscle pain and, in some cases, helps cure insomnia.Cupping has a long history. The Ebers Papyrus, written c. 1550 BC, considered one of the oldest medical textbooks in the Western world, describes how the Egyptians used cupping to help cure some frequent medical issues and how it was also sued by Saharan peoples. Hippocrates, a Greek physician also used this technique c. 400 BC to treat internal disease and some structural problems.Ge Hong (AD 284-364 ) who was a minor southern official during the Eastern Jin Dynasty (Eastern Jin Dynasty AD 317-420), was the first to use it inChina. He was interested in alchemy, herbalism and techniques of longevity. Ge Hong popularized the saying ""Acupuncture and cupping, more than half of the ills cured."" Later on, this method found its way throughout Asia andEurope.In the dry cupping procedure, practitioners place specialized cups on the skin. They then use either heat or an air pump to create suction between the cup and the skin. As a result, a vacuum is created on the patient's skin to dispel stagnant blood and lymph, thereby improving the flow ofqi. It is used on the back, shoulders and other muscles such as those on the back of the neck.Athletes who use this technique claim that it is highly effective. Other athletes who use this technique areUSgymnast Alex Naddour and Belarusian swimmer Pavel Sankovich, who reportedly said that cupping is a great recovery tool. Among American actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aliston and Canadian pop star Justin Bieber uses it. In theUS, the technique was very popular until approximately the middle of the 20th century, and now is only use occasionally by the general population.There has been a significant increase in the sales of cupping equipment following the Phelps incident, according to Jessica MacLean, acting director of the International Cupping Therapy Association. Phelps himself featured a promotional cupping treatment in a recent video for a sponsor.Cupping has been used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. Among them, blood disorders, rheumatic diseases, gynecological problems and skin disorders such as eczema and acne. Those who receive the treatment also claim improvement in their physical and psychological well-being.Cupping has also been used by some as an alternative treatment for cancer. Despite the practitioners' claim for effectiveness, however, the American Cancer Society said recently, ""There is no scientific rationale for expecting any health benefit from cupping,"" warning that the treatment also carries a small risk of burns.It is very difficult to carry out controlled experiments to test the efficacy of cupping. However, an experiment involving 40 patients suffering from knee arthritis, reported less pain after four months of treatment compared to those who hadn't received the cupping treatment.The obvious question is, in essence, how effective is this treatment? One cannot deny that there could be a placebo effect. This is a beneficial effect, produced by a placebo drug or treatment that cannot be attributed to their properties, and must therefore be due to the patient's belief in that treatment. Perhaps, as with other alternative treatment, cupping is as good as it makes you feel.Cesar Chelala is an international public health consultant.http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/92/147090669026.jpgf8bc126d98201914fd1701.jpg"

[Photo/Xinhua]BEIJING - If Diarra Boubacar did not have very good reflexes and a pair of sturdy legs, he might never have been able to distinguish himself as a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China.The 53-year-old still has a good laugh when he talks about his first day working as a doctor at a private hospital in Chengdu, the city in Southwest China known for its panda museum and research base. For three days, he didn't get a single patient. Then on the fourth, a matronly woman opened the door to his office, saw him - and ran away. ""I had to run after her, saying I can help you with the problem,"" he said laughingly.When she stopped, arrested by the sight of a foreigner speaking Chinese, he put on his best persuasive manner. ""If I am not effective, I will not take any money from you,"" he promised her.Reassured partly by that and partly by his Chinese, she came back, underwent treatment and felt better. ""Finally, she started bringing her parents, her husband and they all became my patients,"" he reminisced.Doctor Boubacar grew up in a small town in south-central Mali, a landlocked country in West Africa, which finds it challenging to provide affordable healthcare to its 18 million people, having suffered a series of conflicts following colonial rule by France.From his father, Doctor Thiemoko Diarra, who worked with the International Committee of the Red Cross in his hometown, Boubacar learnt to build up trust with his patients and tried to be conscious of their payment capacity.""When my father saw patients at home, he never took any fee from them,"" he said. ""He would tell me, a doctor's job is to love his patients and serve his community.""African doctor Diarra Boubacar feels the pulse of a patient at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, on Dec 16, 2016. [Photo/Xinhua]A DIFFICULT STARTBoubacar first came to China in 1984 on a student exchange program majoring in Chinese language and culture at Beijing Language and Culture University.After the two-year course, he intended to enroll at Beijing Medical University but then switched to studying TCM at Guangzhou University of TCM, preferring to study something typical in China. The start, as he remembered, was very difficult.""It's not like now when you have places in China where foreigners can go and (attend) class in English,"" he explained to Xinhua.""I went to university with Chinese students (and) we did it in Chinese. So it was very, very hard for us. In the beginning we couldn't understand the teachers.""Since TCM is also related to Chinese history and culture, students have to study ancient Chinese literatures as most of the medical texts are written in ancient Chinese characters. ""That's a subject even the Chinese find difficult; so think of me, a foreigner!"" he said.What inspired him to plod on was the similarities in TCM and traditional African medicine, such as using certain herbs to treat the same diseases and letting out blood.However, the greatest challenge for him was to convince people that even though he was a ""laowai"" - a foreigner - he could still treat them effectively with TCM. Fortunately, his fluency in Chinese improved, which helped.In 1997, he became the first foreigner to receive a doctoral degree in acupuncture from Chengdu University of TCM. The same year, he also got married.He met his wife, Yang Mei, while attending a local church in Chengdu. Since then, his Chinese has further improved as well as his knowledge of Chinese culture. After 20 years of marriage, the proud couple has two children.Boubacar said he is so well integrated into Chinese culture and society that every time he goes back home, his friends complain about his being ""more Chinese than African!""His philosophy is simple. Life is about living in harmony with friends, and it ""doesn't matter whether here in China or in Africa.""Besides his work in a private sector, Boubacar has also been working with Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international medical humanitarian organization, going to underdeveloped villages to treat impoverished patients.A major part of his work was to treat leprosy patients. In 1999, Boubacar participated in an HIV prevention and awareness project in Sichuan and Southwest China's Yunnan province, where he is based today.""In the past few years, AIDS prevention and treatment has really improved in China and TCM is being used effectively to build up the immunity system,"" he told ChinAfrica magazine.African doctor Diarra Boubacar writes out a prescription for a patient at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province. [Photo/Xinhua]""AFRICAN NORMAN BETHUNE""Due to his work in the community, where he has also been training village doctors in TCM, Boubacar is also known as ""China's barefoot doctor"" and the ""African Norman Bethune.""Doctor Bethune was a Canadian frontline doctor who ran mobile hospitals in north China in the 1930s.Boubacar's contribution has been recognized by the Chinese authorities. He has been awarded by the local government of Yunnan and hailed as one of China's top 10 humanitarian workers in a public vote organized by a Chinese TV channel. In 2013, he received a national award from Premier Li Keqiang.Buoyed by his medical expertise, experience, and the connections that he has built up in China, he has a dream. For 10 years he had been dreaming the dream but finally, it is on solid ground.""I want to have this big center,"" he described his vision. ""I want to (build) not only a hospital but also an educational center where people can come and learn about Chinese medicine.""The center, besides combining a hospital and a teaching institution, will also have a facility for advanced research into both TCM and African herbal medicine. Boubacar has been networking with 15 African doctors studying in China and is hopeful they would be part of the project.He is also looking for investors, in China and elsewhere. This dream, he says would not have been born if he had not come to China.""All these years in China, I learned a lot,"" he said. ""I am very thankful and grateful to my teachers ... Now I have got enough resources and enough knowledge. I will be able to go back to Africa and start this project.""He plans to start on a small scale and will be training doctors in Africa like he did in rural China. ""If they learn TCM, they will be able to treat people in Africa in a very cheap and effective way,"" he said.TCM has received global attention after the Chinese government's vigorous promotion, followed by Chinese pharmacologist Tu Youyou receiving the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2015 for her formulation of a cure for malaria from ancient Chinese medical texts.The rise of TCM on the international stage inspires him. ""Chinese medicine has become more and more well-known in the world. We have this new initiative. It's time now to do it,"" he said.African doctor Diarra Boubacar checks the patients' medical records at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Chengdu.

While he is promoting Chinese culture in Africa through TCM, he wants Chinese to learn more about Africa and African culture.""I hope the Chinese can understand Africa (better) because China and Africa, we have a very long history together. We have been growing together,"" he said.However, many Chinese, he said, do not still understand Africa. ""Africa is not one country, it is 54 countries. Different countries have different customs,"" he said. ""Many think Africa is only one country (full of) famine and war. We have more than that.""African doctor Diarra Boubacar works with a medical intern at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.

159,1160.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Will TCM ever go mainstream?,"While the most familiar and widely used traditional Chinese medicine method (TCM) used in the United States is acupuncture, TCM's use of herbal formulas has made few inroads, reports Dong Leshuo from Washington.Dr Quansheng Lu, an acupuncturist, at his Chinese herbal pharmacy in the Wholelife Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Center in Rockville, Maryland, on Dec 8. Provided to China Daily.At the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, one of the largest and most prestigious medical universities in the world, hundreds of the world's top medical researchers and practitioners listened as a Chinese lady spoke.The speaker on Dec 7 was Youyou Tu, awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria."" Tu, the first Chinese national to win a Nobel Prize, talked about how she with other Chinese scientists, extracted the malaria-fighting compound Artemisinin from the plant Artemisia annua to treat Malaria.She called her breakthrough ""a successful example of collective exploration in Chinese medicine.""""Artemisinin is a gift to the world from Traditional Chinese Medicine,"" Tu said.Shennong, an emperor of China who is said to have lived about 4,500 years ago, is thought to have taught the ancient Chinese the use of herbal drugs. Chinese herbal medicine, along with acupuncture and many different practices and therapies, make up Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).For more than 4,000 years, TCM has been an integral part of Chinese culture and the predominant medical treatment for a large part of the world's most populous country.But the Chinese herbal medicine, from which Tu extracted Artemisinin to fight malaria, is still not a legal drug in the United States.Twilight zoneChinese herbal medicine continued to remain in the twilight zone of medical treatment in the US until 1994 with the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA).President Bill Clinton signed the Act into law, saying that ""after several years of intense efforts, manufacturers, experts in nutrition, and legislators, acting in a conscientious alliance with consumers at the grassroots level, have moved successfully to bring common sense to the treatment of dietary supplements under regulation and law.""Under the act, Chinese herbal medicine can only be sold to supplement a diet, must be taken by the mouth and contain a dietary ingredient, which includes vitamins, minerals and herbs or other botanicals.While the Chinese practice of acupuncture is accepted and practiced widely in the US, it will be much harder for Chinese herbal medicine to integrate because ""there are all kinds of issues about safety around quality control,"" said Ted J. Kaptchuk, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of The Web that Has No Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine, a book on the theory and practice of Chinese alternative medicine.""The complexity of Chinese herbal medicine is much more than acupuncture. It's going to be a much slower process for Chinese herbs,"" said Kaptchuk, who went to Macao to study TCM from 1971 to 1975 and graduated with a degree in Chinese Medicine.In 2007, an editorial in the scientific journal Nature described TCM as ""largely just pseudoscience, with no rational mechanism of action for most of its therapies.""""Traditional Chinese medicine has an enormous treasure of different herbs for different conditions, which have been trying to be utilized in the Western world,"" said Dr Brian Berman, a tenured professor of family and community medicine, director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Integrative Medicine and president and founder of the Institute of Integrative Health.As a Western trained medical doctor who was looking for solutions to chronic diseases in particular, Berman started to study acupuncture, and the Chinese exercises Taiqi and Qigong about 30 years ago.""I think there are many challenges. One of them is the quality of product. Some of the herbal companies are very good. But some of the other products are not as good, giving the companies a bad reputation,"" Berman said.Thousands of herbsWhen it comes to Chinese herbal medicine, a single formula is usually composed of many herbs, each of which has numerous chemical compounds. Thousands of herbs -- mainly plant but also animal and mineral products -- are used in TCM. They can be taken as capsules, powders or tea. If taken in the wrong dose, they can be toxic.There is concern about quality control and the consistency of herbal preparation because quality and chemical constituents vary from field to field, season to season and one extraction process to another.Due to inherent differences in how Western medicine and TCM are practiced, employing the Western medicine-based gold standard research methods to evaluate TCM is challenging, said Berman.""Many patients are being told by their doctors that we don't really know about these therapies. They are not collectively introducing them,"" Berman said. ""We have large clinical trials. We have a very long clinical trial of acupuncture and there is a published paper that it is a safe in practice,"" he said.Berman said that it is even hard to do research on herbal medicine.""When we decided to do a Chinese herbal formula study, it was hard for us to recruit people to do the study. Because people were concerned about whether the medicine would contaminate them,"" Berman said.""Getting the funding to do the research is also a challenge, but I think the challenges are getting easier and easier. There was a huge challenge to even study it. People asked what it was like and why are you doing this. Now I think people realize we have to look at that. People are suffering from a lot of problems that we don't have the answers to, so we have to look widely because Chinese herbal medicine has a lot to offer. And I think we should keep costs at a low level so that it will not be so expensive,"" Berman said.Major problemInsurance companies pose another major problem to the legitimacy of TCM in the US. A patient can make an insurance claim for acupuncture but not for herbal treatment.""Most of the time, acupuncture works best with medicine. That's why acupuncturists in China usually also prescribe Western medicine as well as herbal medicine to the patients. But in the US, without an MD license, the acupuncturist cannot prescribe the Western medicine. We can give the patient herbal medicine, but the cost must be covered by the patient,"" said Dr Quansheng Lu, who worked in China as a doctor specializing in TCM for 14 years and is a licensed acupuncturist in Rockville, Maryland.He said one of the challenges facing TCM in the US has been positioning it in the health system, whereas in China it is a mainstream medical and health solution. Lu thinks more communication and promotion of TCM needs to be done in the US to put it on equal footing with its use in China.Many Chinese remedies appear to have significant therapeutic value and some work on conditions for which Western doctors have no pharmaceutical drugs, according to Dr Andrew Weil, a longtime proponent of TCM to treat a wide range of conditions.""People use TCM for diseases that have not been successfully treated by modern medicine. Sometimes for diseases when there is no other kind of treatment available,"" Kaptchuk said.One of Lu's patients was a senior executive at an international organization in Washington. He had been suffering from eczema for a long time and the condition seriously affected his life and work. Despite seeing dozens of dermatologists in the area, including some specialists at established medical institutions such as the Johns Hopkins Hospital, nothing helped.Lu said he treated him with acupuncture and herbal medicine in 2014, and after a month, the man was fully cured.""I think they (American patients) are looking for treatments that are safe and effective and that work particularly for some of the chronic diseases like diabetes and pain problems,"" Berman said.""Things like pain are probably the most important to be treated by acupuncture. For herbal medicine, function disorders would be important,"" Kaptchuk said.To get accepted in the US, Berman said TCM will have to undergo a ""gold standard"" medical trial and efficacy study.""I think acupuncture and other forms of TCM can be shown that they are effective to treat diseases. I think without that (the trial), it won't be accepted so much. If they (TCM) really want to go to the mainstream, they have to go through clinical trials and be evaluated in that way,"" Berman said.He said several Chinese herbal medicine trials have been done and are being done in different parts of the world. ""Among them, there are about 35 Chinese medicines in trial in areas such as for headaches,"" Berman said.Danshen Dripping PillIn the US, the one that is the closest to the finish line is the compound Danshen Dripping Pill, a Chinese herbal treatment for angina and coronary heart disease. It successfully completed the FDA's Phase II clinical trials in July 2010. Once it passes Phase III investigations, which would most likely happen in this year, it would be the first Chinese medicine to become a prescription drug in the US.This would be an FDA endorsement of the herbal combination to treat potentially serious illnesses, said Mark Blumenthal, founder and executive director of the American Botanical Council, according to an earlier article published in 2014 in China Daily.The Danshen Dripping Pill is one of the products produced by Tasly Pharmaceuticals, Inc that it calls ""modern Traditional Chinese Medicine (mTCM)"".""The first thing we did to get it approved was to build a solid foundation in science and collect enough evidence,"" said Henry Sun, president and CEO of Tasly, based in Rockville, Maryland. ""Our goal is to bring our well-evidenced mTCM products to benefit American patients. ""Sun said he believes that the development of chemical pharmaceuticals has been slowing down and reached a bottleneck because lead compounds, new structures and disease targets have been explored extensively. ""But in a way, mTCM is all natural, and it provides a new, significant resource for the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals,"" he said.""If the Danshen Dripping Pill is approved by the FDA, I believe there will be lots of pharmaceutical companies doing research on it. They may develop new chemical pharmaceuticals from it. In this sense, the Chinese medicine, which is based on extensive clinical experiences, could contribute a whole repository to science and clinical research in the future,"" Sun said.And in her speech in Stockholm, Tu said: ""If we inherit and keep developing (TCM), there will be new findings and inventions which will benefit every human being.""Cleveland ClinicIn January 2014, the Cleveland Clinic, one of the country's top hospitals, opened its herbal clinic. It is part of Ohio hospital's Center for Integrative Medicine, which also provides acupuncture, holistic psychotherapy and massage therapy.""Western medicine does acute care phenomenally.... But we're still struggling a bit with our chronic-care patients and this fills in that gap and can be used concurrently,"" Melissa Young, an integrative medicine physician at the clinic told The Wall Street Journal in a story published in April 2014.To be treated, patients must be referred by a doctor and will be monitored to ensure that there are no drug-herbal interactions or other complications.Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University and NorthShore University HealthSystem, affiliated with the University of Chicago, both include herbal medicine among their offerings.TreatmentsHerbal medicine is used to treat a variety of conditions either as a primary treatment or in conjunction with conventional medicine or other treatments and is especially useful in chronic illness.Conditions often seen by herbalists include: allergies; asthma; arthritis; anxiety; depression and stress related conditions; acne and other skin problems; anxiety; digestive and bowel conditions; cystitis and prostate enlargement; infertility; menstrual disorders and symptoms; angina; high blood pressure; poor circulation; varicose veins; infections and immune deficiency; headaches; migraine; insomnia; and chronic fatigue.Contact the writer at leshuodong@chinadailyusa.comPan Jialiang in Washington contributed to the story.http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/63/145333973600.jpg180373d28730180a2b8403.jpg"

However, there is a lull in demand for various Chinese herbal and patent medications because customers seem to be wary of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's forthcoming decision.Therein lies the twist in the tale. Just as traditional Chinese medicine makes waves in the UK and the rest of Europe with alternative therapies such as acupuncture and massage, it finds itself being denied market access for medications.Traditional Chinese medicine, which has evolved over 4,000 years, relies largely on patented and herbal medications to prevent and help the human body fight ailments, and treatments to relieve pain and restore balance in the body.According to the proposal the MHRA floated on July 9, the sale of all unlicensed manufactured herbal medicinal products will be halted in the UK from next year.

How effective is traditional Chinese medicine in infertility treatment? Such questions were passed by doctors from Hanover Medical School to a delegation of TCM experts from China earlier this month.The delegation from the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences paid a visit to Hanover Medical School for TCM cooperation with Germany where they discussed academic research and clinical practice in areas including pain treatment, gynecological diseases, and rehabilitation therapy.Both academic institutions plan to explore scientific TCM research with concerted efforts in areas such as kidney disease, hypertension, gynecological diseases, and pain treatment, as well as training and exchange programs of medical personnel in TCM. Students practise point massage, a traditional Chinese medical care solution to relieve patients' headache during a TCM training in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Mo Xiao / For China DailyZhang Boli, the president of CACMS, said that the international cooperation was an effective way to promote TCM development and introduce China's TCM research achievements to the rest of the world.At the same time, advanced technologies in other countries could be used to work towards the modernization of TCM.The delegation, headed by Boli, was here to implement a memorandum of cooperation signed with MHH during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China in June.Zhang said the medical community in Europe was gaining deeper insight into TCM. ""I notice such a trend. In the past, TCM conferences in Europe were mostly attended by Chinese, but now, things have changed; most of attendees are Europeans.""""An increasing number of German doctors are beginning to accept TCM,"" Liu Yang, project representative of the German Association of TCM said. ""If Western medicine does not work in some cases, they would seek help from TCM.""Owing to Germany's import restrictions on Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture plays a key role in TCM therapy in Germany. Currently, the German Doctors' Association for Acupuncture headquartered in Munich has over 8,700 members.""At least 9,000 practitioners of Western medicine with prescription rights are applying acupuncture as a therapy in Germany,"" said Zheng Wen, a gynecologist of Hanover Medical School.Zheng has been treating patients using acupuncture for over five years. As the number of patients has risen, her work time has increased from half a day per week to five days per week and she now has a room set up exclusively for TCM.However, it is still a great challenge for TCM to gain full recognition from the medical community in Germany. Despite a huge number of successful clinical cases, the theory behind it still remains inexplicable to Western science. ""This is one of the hurdles in the way of TCM development in Germany and one immediate consequence is the exclusion of TCM from the medical insurance system.""At present, medical insurance companies in Germany only cover acupuncture fees for knee pain and back pain treatment. All other TCM treatments must be paid for by the patients themselves. Therefore, TCM can be too costly for Germans whose Western medical treatments are usually fully covered by insurance.Zheng said cooperation with top medical schools and universities on scientific research could help boost the general recognition of TCM. Both sides can start with areas where TCM demonstrates good curative effects in clinical practices. Joint efforts should be made to conduct research on the functioning mechanisms behind it and publish related academic papers.""TCM boasts a long history of development. In many cases, how it works cannot be explained. Through cooperation from both sides, we may have some new findings,"" said Christopher Baum, the president of MHH.(China Daily 07/25/2016 page16)http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/2/146947392019.jpgf04da2db112218ff9c3c20.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/100/146947392122.jpgf04da2db112218ff9c4f21.jpg"

[Photo provided to China Daily] The sex-booster herb Schisandraceae, widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for 2,000 years, has shown promise in treating HIV/AIDS, according to a 20-year-long study led by the Kunming Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Native to North China, the Korean Peninsula and Russia, the plant has been used in TCM treatment as a tonic that enhances the function of the liver and kidneys and improves memory and sexual performance.Notably, several derivatives of the herb's lignin, which is the compound extracted from the leaves and stems of the woody vine plant, have strong anti-HIV properties and low toxicity, according to Sun Handong, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research.""The lab-engineered derivatives can kill HIV, so the finding paves the way for future anti-HIV drug research and development,"" he said.However, whether the finding will lead to a cure for HIV/AIDS won't be known anytime soon. ""It definitely will require more research and takes a long time,"" Sun said.Preclinical research into the anti-HIV derivatives has been carried out with the support of the National Major Scientific and Technological Special Project, according to Pu Jianxin, a researcher for the study.Wang Jian, a TCM doctor who specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment at the Beijing-based Guang'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, urged further research.""The findings are still preliminary, and whether it works on the clinical side remains a question,"" Wang said.Since 2004, China has treated more than 27,000 sufferers of HIV/AIDS with TCM treatment. Studies found that with a combination of mainstream antiretroviral therapy and TCM treatment, the patients benefited in particular by experiencing boosted immunity, he said.""Current TCM treatment for HIV/AIDS mainly focuses on immunity maintenance. Unlike that, the Schisandraceae study showed that the compound can kill the virus itself,"" Wang added.Pu, one of the study's researchers, said that to advance research and development of new drugs, such studies of natural products will play an increasing role.Among the drugs derived from natural compounds, the anti-malaria treatment qinghaosu, also known as artemisinin, is the most well-known among the Chinese. Pharmaceutical chemist Tu Youyou and her team screened over 2,000 TCM herbs and eventually discovered that artemisinin from sweet wormwood, an aromatic herb used widely in TCM, was an effective treatment for malarial fever."

She took the undergraduate course in acupuncture, moxibustion and tuina, or therapeutic massage used in TCM.Now she is pursuing a master's degree in traditional Chinese medicine.Acupuncture is just one component of TCM, she says. To better understand the essence of acupuncture, she has read ancient texts written in classical Chinese, the biggest challenge of her studies.A replica of an ancient bronze figure used to teach acupuncture.

When I master enough TCM knowledge, I can integrate it into clinical practice, which is based on both medical theory and observation,"" she says.She is one of a growing number of foreign students of traditional medicine in China. Zhang Daliang, director of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, says TCM is the most popular field of natural sciences for foreign students in China.""TCM has been spread to 183 countries and regions. International education has played an important role in promoting TCM worldwide,"" says Zhang.Chinese-American Chelsea Qi Xie is also a student at the International School of BUCM. She is an overseas Chinese and her mother is a pharmacist. She is studying TCM not only to learn about her cultural roots, but also because it is becoming more accepted in the US.""Acupuncture is an alternative therapy with relatively few side effects. Acupuncture services are available in many big hospitals in the US, and registered acupuncture practitioners must pass formal exams. To my knowledge, there are around 20,000 registered acupuncturists in the state of California alone,"" Xie says.The Beijing university has also established relations with 108 universities and research institutions in 30 countries and regions around the world, boosting the general recognition of TCM abroad.The TCM master's program offered by BUCM and the University of Barcelona medical school since September 2016 is the first such program officially accredited by the European Union. Meanwhile, in collaboration with Canada's Kwantlen Polytechnic University, BUCM runs the first joint undergraduate degree program in North America.In cooperation with foreign universities and institutions, it has also set up TCM centers in Russia, Australia, the US and elsewhere, creating integrated platforms for medical services, education and research.BUCM president Xu Anlong says that although TCM is popular in many Western countries, more strategies are needed to put it into the international medicine system.TCM centers have effectively cultivated practitioners around the world, Xu says. ""But more importantly, the effectiveness of TCM has won recognition among local people. The center in Russia is very popular and I know some patients drive more than 10 hours to be treated there.""BUCM arranges up to 1,044 hours of clinical practice for undergraduate students, with a variety of experiences woven throughout the learning period.Moy interned at The Third Affiliated Hospital of BUCM and the China-Japan Friendship Hospital during her undergraduate studies.When Moy graduates, she plans to open an acupuncture clinic in Malaysia.""I want more Malaysians to know the wonders of TCM and receive sound TCM medical services,"" she says.http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/38/148712705667.jpgb083fe96faac1a0ddc8308.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/77/148712705863.jpgb083fe96faac1a0dde4a0b.jpg"

In December, Wang Zuoqiao, Secretary of the Party Committee of HUCM, during a visit to Russia with the Hubei Delegation of Higher Education, had extensively discussed educational and academic cooperation with the Pushkin State Russian Language Institute and Saratov State Medical University under the framework of ""One Belt, One Road"" initiatives.On March 26th, at the fifth Teachers' Congress, Wang Hua, president of HUCM, explicitly put forward in his annual Work Report that HUCM would participate in ""One Belt, One Road"" initiatives and seize the golden opportunity for the school's long-term development. Wang said that the university should expand collaborative areas with foreign universities and academic organizations under the strategy and steadily improve the intercollegiate cooperation to a new level. According to his report, in 2015 HUCM would improve its academic communication with the concerned universities especially those in Thailand, Britain, and Australia and strive for new cooperative programs in education.He also declared that HUCM would help to establish the Confucius Institute in Canada, which will be the first Confucius Institute co-founded by HUCM and a foreign university.An exterior of Hubei University of Chinese Medicine.

For HUCM, a solid foundation of international cooperation has been laid and a brand-new picture is just unfolding.The university has been committed to offering international education for overseas students and education services for students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.It started to recruit students out of the Chinese mainland in 1986 and has been dubbed the university with the largest number of exchange students in Hubei Province.In 1993, it ranked among the first universities offering TCM, in which it trained overseas students and accepted Hong Kong students without an entrance examination. Currently, there are more than 500 exchange students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and other countries, especially Asian countries like India, Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand.The number of students under the education program jointly funded by China and foreign countries has amounted to nearly 300. HUCM has built good cooperative relations with many Asian, European and American universities.In August, Karim Massimov, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan and his delegation paid a visit to Hubei province. During the visit, HUCM' specially-arranged medical team took full charge of the delegation's medical care and their superb medical skills and caring service were highly praised. The delegation claimed that they were willing to learn TCM from China and strengthen the bilateral cooperation in the field of traditional medicine in the next phase.The authors are faculty members with School of Foreign Languages, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine."

He started learning traditional Chinese medicine in 2013, taking part in a course conducted by the university in his hometown of Budapest.Students of the program study four years there, then they travel to Harbin to complete their training with a one-year clinical practice.""I became familiar with TCM as early as 20 years ago,"" he says. ""At that time, a good friend of mine studied tai chi with an experienced TCM doctor from China. He often told me interesting stories about what he had learned from him. ""Since I participate in a couple of full contact sports, I often suffer from sports injuries and my friend advised me to try a couple of TCM rehabilitation methods,"" he adds, noting: ""It really relieved my pain, and helped with other, not necessarily sports related, issues as well.""However, it was not until 2012 that he started thinking about delving deeper into TCM.""Up until that time I was working as a journalist, or rather, a critic, but I got pretty bored with it, and since my interest had shifted toward sports medicine, physical therapy and diet coaching, I decided to change profession. Getting a TCM degree seemed like the reasonable thing to do.""He started to learn Chinese at a local language training school as the first step.""Due to TCM being a part of the traditional Chinese cultural heritage, I thought learning Chinese was an absolute necessity,"" he explains. ""As it later turned out, having learned Chinese a year before starting the university program was the single best decision I could have made. It gave me such an advantage that nothing else could have.""However, despite his language proficiency, Susanszky admitted that studying TCM is not easy for him and some other foreigners.Susanszky doesn't remember how many thin needles he inserted into himself during the process of learning acupuncture.""I think everyone learning acupuncture first practices on themselves, then on some friends and family - which in my case was my 86-year-old grandma, who, like a lot of the elderly in Hungary, suffers from all sorts of musculoskeletal problems, like arthritis, scapulohumeral periarthritis and slipped discs,"" he says.""The illnesses have caused her difficulty with walking and surgery didn't seem to be the best solution for her.

She can walk without pain and is able to work in the garden,"" he reports.In 2017, Susanszky had the opportunity to get a one-year internship at the Affiliated Hospital with the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine in Jiangsu province.""It was quite a precious experience, even if it meant that I graduated a year behind my classmates,"" he says.

He had secretly studied classics of traditional Chinese medicine for nearly 10 years during the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76).Jiao was acclaimed as a ""needle master"" after he was said to have cured hundreds of patients at home and abroad. In 1986, his scalp acupuncture technique was recognized as a breakthrough in TCM by China's Ministry of Health. Jiao had organized 56 training sessions by the early 1990s, mostly in the four-story hospital building. At least 1,000 doctors from about 50 countries had attended his classes.But the hospital's profitability declined dramatically after Jiao retired in the late 1990s. Doctors attribute the decline to competition from Western medicine, as well as the poor management.Xue Xiaomo, former head nurse at the hospital, said the decline was almost predictable.""Jiao is a brand. The leading practitioner's reputation is the most important asset of the hospital. People just believe in him,"" Xue said.Four years ago, the local government brought in Zhao Jiwei, a veteran neurologist, to revive the dying clinic.""When I came here, wild grass had overgrown the yard. Almost all the doctors had quit,"" Zhao said.But some foreign patients occasionally came for treatment after hearing Jiao's story, which strengthened Zhao's confidence that the hospital could be saved. He decided to focus the hospital on the treatment of cerebral palsy in children, while the neurology department would become the main breadwinner. He used his connections in the field to invite capable doctors.Zhao borrowed money from friends while applying for government funding. The hospital was renovated and new equipment was purchased. He invited some of the old scalp acupuncture practitioners to come back.Zhao spends most of the profits arranging further education and training for doctors and nurses.Yang Xiao, deputy director of the hospital, said the expense is well worth it, as improvement in staff quality lays a solid foundation for increased revenues.""That's why we can regain the trust of the foreign patients in a short time,"" Yang said.B. Kurbanov, a 28-year-old Russian TCM practitioner, has played a key role in introducing 600 to 700 patients - mainly children suffering from cerebral palsy, from Russia, Central Asia and East Europe - to the hospital since 2013.Fluent in Chinese, Kurbanov studied at Shanxi University of Chinese Medicine for five years and later became a TCM practitioner at a hospital in Yuncheng in 2011, where he learned scalp acupuncture techniques from Jiao's disciples, even though the hospital was in virtual bankruptcy.After Zhao's arrival, Kurbanov easily joined in his efforts to revive it. Currently, there are 24 foreign children receiving cerebral palsy treatment in the hospital. And there are dozens of other foreign patients waiting to be admitted.A father from Russia who has brought his 13-year-old son to the hospital eight times said: ""There is acupuncture, massage, medicated baths and other kinds of physical therapy. The comprehensive use of these methods is effective. In Russia, one place usually has only one treatment method, and we have to travel from place to place for others. It is not convenient.""Zhao observed: ""It is actually the value of TCM that attracts these foreign patients.""He added that the government should pay attention to protecting TCM - with top-level design and a development plan - as it deserves a place in ongoing medical reforms.Contact the writers at sunruisheng@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 09/27/2017 page5)"

176,1177.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,TCM therapy offers much food for thought,"I started applying small amounts of medicinal paste on several acupuncture points on my chest and back from day one of the first 10 hottest days of the lunar calendar. The paste is supposed to help cure some chronic diseases if you apply it on the exact acupuncture points during the first, second and third hottest periods, each of which usually lasts for 10 days, from July to early August.I have no idea whether it works or not. Yet I respect the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, which sees the human body as a whole system, and considers the unrestricted flow of both blood and qi (the invisible but vital force inherent in all things) throughout the body vital to a person's health. Based on the relationship between the flow of blood and qi in a person's body and his or her health, TCM insists that an illness should never be considered a disorder of a specific part or organ but a disorder of the whole system. Being holistic in nature, TCM works to fix the dysfunctional operation of a person's system even as it treats a specific problem.The medicinal paste, a mixture of several ground herbs, I am using is supposed to help rid patients of respiratory diseases that ""hibernate"" in the summer and afflict them in the winter. According to TCM philosophy, some diseases that flare up in the winter can be cured with herbal medicines in the summer and vice-versa, and therefore it is easier to treat people's ""inner cold"" and cultivate their vital energy in the summer so that they can better resist winter-related ailments.I don't buy some quacks' claims of TCM therapies having miraculous effects. Yet the holistic philosophy of TCM can be extended to other diseases afflicting humankind. Popping a pill to cure a headache, as a Chinese saying goes, is to treat a symptom without trying to find the real disease. For example, every case of corruption is a symptom of a graver illness and should be aggressively treated. But while using one set of medicines to treat the symptom, the doctors should detect the cause of the symptom (that is, the real disease) and use more powerful medicines to cure it.The number of corrupt officials serving sentences and the amount of money recovered from them are unprecedented. But successfully plugging the loopholes in the administrative and economic systems, which are exploited by some to make illegal profits, would be a far greater achievement. And for that, we first have to find those loopholes, using methods similar to those employed by TCM practitioners to clinically diagnose a patient's illness.Governance, rather good governance, is a term officials at all levels frequently use when talking about realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. For good governance, too, TCM philosophy can be of great importance. An official's governance capability will greatly improve if he or she approaches the problems in the same way a TCM practitioner diagnoses a physical ailment.Organizing interviews or surveys to find out what people feel about the policies that have been implemented is similar to a TCM doctor feeling a patient's pulse and checking the tongue to diagnose an ailment. Only by finding out whether or not some policies have compromised the quality of people's lives can the policymakers identify the root of a problem and take measures to solve it.Making and implementing policies to only deal with a specific ailment, physical or otherwise, without bothering to identify its root cause and treating it properly is like popping a pill to cure a headache without knowing what actually has caused it. The headache will keep returning to nag the person until he or she resorts to holistic treatment to cure the real illness.The author is a senior writer with China Daily. zhuyuan@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 08/12/2017 page5)"

The number of students has seen an average growth of 10 percent year over year.About 1,700 international students are taking a five-year course with a bachelor's degree like Vandelli, and there are also a large number of international students taking shorter courses for several weeks at the university like Maria Alexandrino from Portugal.Alexandrino, 45, has worked as a microbiology researcher for 17 years, mainly in Germany, and she began taking TCM classes during weekends and holidays five years ago, getting interested by the time-honored medical science after learning kung fu and reading Huaidi Neijing.Having just finished the three-week practice at the Guangzhou-based university's affiliated hospital, Alexandrino will return to Germany and finish the remaining courses in Western medicine.In Germany, in order to be allowed to practice Chinese medicine, Alexandrino has to study Western medicine for two years and pass a test in front of a panel of doctors assigned by the government.""The government wants to ensure that I can recognize any kind of emergency. Western medicine is better at handling emergencies, such as organic trauma, big wounds and heart attacks because Western medicine was developed during wars,"" she said.""But Chinese medicine is superior in another kinds of diseases that have increased a lot in Western countries, that is, subclinical-level diseases.""""In Western countries, the average state of health is very good. There are almost no infectious diseases because of vaccines and antibiotics. But the subclinical-level diseases have caused a lot of problems to patients and cannot be well treated by Western medicine.""For example, a patient may tell the doctor that he or she has a headache but nothing wrong is shown in the brain's CT scan. So a Western doctor can only prescribe painkillers and after two or three years, the patient will not only have a headache but also a bad stomach because of the painkiller's side effects, Alexandrino said.""Headache, depression, neck pain and back pain are actually caused by anxiety and pressure most of the time. Chinese medicine is superior because the treatment has no side effects and it also can treat both the symptoms and the root cause if well done,"" she said.Vandelli also sees bright prospects for TCM in Western countries. He said that he treated six patients a day with massage and acupuncture during his winter holiday in France, most of whom were his friends and his parents' friends.""People are more and more interested in Chinese medicine because they see them as mostly natural, especially the older generation. In Nice, southern France, where I come from, there are a lot of rich, retired people who don't want to spend the rest of their life taking pills,"" he said.Vandelli started the practice at the affiliated hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine this year and plans to stay in the university to pursue a master's degree after finishing the five-year study.He said that five years are not enough to have a thorough grasp of TCM, in which a practitioner needs years of experience to make quick, precise diagnoses.""My ultimate goal is to go back to my country to open an academy for martial arts, next to which there is a clinic where I can treat people's sports injuries or other postural imbalances caused in daily life with Chinese medicine and therapies,"" he said.""Before that, I want to stay in China for a longer time to learn more about Chinese language and culture, which will help me better understand Chinese medicine,"" he added.xujingxi@chinadaily.com.cnJulien Vandelli treats a sportsman from Russia suffering from neck pain at the university's affiliated hospital on Sept 22, stretching his muscles with tui na, medical massage.

Instead of prescribing painkillers, Shipetko's Chinese doctor Tang Yi performed the traditional Chinese therapy of ""tuina"", which literally means ""push-and-pinch.""Every morning, Shipetko received the therapy at the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, then spent the rest of the day bathing in the sun.""It is great,"" she told Xinhua through an interpreter. ""No pills, no injections, but I feel much better.""Shipetko is one of tens of thousands of Russians who flock to Hainan every year. The island province has received 800,000 Russian tourists in the past seven years.Almost 80 percent of them tried some form of traditional Chinese therapy during their stay[#xff0d]either to treat a particular ailment or simply for wellness, health authorities said.Rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy, traditional Chinese medicine, also called TCM, has in recent years gained popularity in a world dominated by modern Western medicine.Clinics have proliferated outside of China, but many face challenges such as getting herbs across the border or luring experienced professionals to work overseas.As a result, more foreigners are coming to China for TCM treatment or therapy.The boom is particularly felt in Sanya, where Russian-language advertisements for acupuncture pop up across the city.Global flowInternational medical tourism became popular in the mid-20th century with wealthy European and North American patients traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery sprees.In the markets that first responded to the demand, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Costa Rica, a variety of modestly priced procedures were offered.The sector flourished with the rise of quality health care, commercial aviation, and the internet. It is now a multibillion-dollar industry.US-based industry resource company Patients Beyond Borders estimates that between 9.8 million and 14.8 million patients visited overseas hospitals and clinics in 2016.People are tempted by lower costs, quality care, improved patient experience, specialty treatments, and the lure of ""the new and different,"" according to the company.It said that in 2013 alone, more than 900,000 US nationals headed overseas for ""nearly every imaginable type"" of medical treatment: weight loss surgery in Mexico, heart valve replacements in Thailand, hip resurfacing and traditional treatments such as Ayurveda in India, and fertility treatments in Israel.In Asia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea are the rising stars, drawing a great majority of patients within the region.""We see a rising market in China,"" said Patients Beyond Borders CEO Josef Woodman in an email.He said China can successfully compete with mature markets in the region, as it is strong in TCM treatment and its health care infrastructure is improving fast.A group of Russian tourists visit the Nanshan Buddhism cultural resort in Sanya, Hainan province, in November 2012. CHEN WENWU / FOR CHINA DAILYCups, needles, moreAcupuncture, cupping, tuina massage, and herbal medicine are some of the best-known TCM treatments overseas, but TCM master Professor Hu Kaiwen believes the ancient healing system has even more to offer.Hu, president of Dongfang Hospital in downtown Beijing, is a veteran oncologist who specializes in integrating TCM with conventional Western medicine to treat advanced tumor patients.While Western medicine sees cancer as abnormal cells to be annihilated, TCM considers the ailment a sign of imbalance of body and mind and prioritizes restoring balance rather than annihilation.Hu said one Chinese philosophical saying applies: ""Going beyond the limit is as bad as falling short.""His therapy combines minimally invasive surgery with post-surgery TCM care. It offers an alternative to patients who do not respond well to chemotherapy or radiation.Hu said the herbs can work just as well to lengthen the lifespan and improve quality of life, but cost only a fraction of costly targeted Western drugs.Wang Tiansong, president of the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said foreign patients with cerebral palsy and strokes have also responded well to TCM treatment.Last year, the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine set up a Chinese medicine center in St. Petersburg as an outpost.""TCM is centered around being green and natural, making it compatible with Russians' passion for nature,"" said the center's Chinese director Wang Chaoyang.Infra, promotionHainan is not the only tourism hot spot where foreign medical travelers swarm.In China's northwestern Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the Russians are joined by Kazakhs and other Central Asians from across the border.At the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University in Urumqi, signs are written in three languages[#xff0d]Chinese, Uygur and Russian. About 80 foreigners sought treatment in the first three months after the hospital opened its international department.Wu Yue, a top hospital official, said the demand from across the border is so strong that the hospital plans to start building an Asian Orthopedic Center.These developments have been incorporated into the Belt and Road Initiative the Chinese leadership proposed in 2013. Xinjiang has positioned itself as a regional hub that offers services to the region, including health care.Meanwhile, Hainan, once a key stop on the ancient Maritime Silk Road, is already being marketed as an international tourist island.Investors have now set their eyes on medical infrastructure.A public-private partnership cancer hospital, which cost 2.9 billion yuan ($426 million), opened last year in Hainan's capital city of Haikou. Equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and 1,200 beds, the hospital mainly targets wealthy treatment seekers from outside the province.China's State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the National Development and Reform Commission late last year set a target to build 10 TCM health tourism model zones offering medical treatment, wellness, recuperation, and elder care by 2020.Woodman said China is on the path to establishing quality health care infrastructure. In 2007, there were only three Chinese medical centers accredited by the Joint Commission International, while today there are more than 77.The next step, he said, will be to work toward promoting China as a medical tourism destination by working with the travel and economic development sectors.Some have sensed the business opportunity.Russian national Yana recently quit her tour guide job to join the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine as a marketing officer.Yana, who has been a tour guide in Sanya for 12 years, said her new job is promising.""A lot of my Russian clients know about TCM and are interested in coming over,"" she said.http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/4/149368645624.jpgd8cb8a14fbeb1a720dcc1a.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/37/149368645740.jpgd8cb8a14fbeb1a720e3e1b.jpg "

It was a success. ""I've seen traditional Chinese medicine on TV, so for two days in a row, I went to queue at the clinic before it opened at 8am,"" he said.Julaihi is one of an increasing number of Bruneians, or rather local Malays, who have become interested in TCM, whose popularity was once confined to ethnic Chinese in the Southeast Asian country.Since it opened four years ago, Beijing Tong Ren Tang, the first and only large-scale Chinese herbal pharmacy in Brunei, has been looking for ways to increase people's recognition of TCM and Chinese culture.Wen Zhongqing, branch manager, said: ""We are here not just to serve Chinese Bruneians - although they are still our top customers in a small market. We are here to encourage more local people to accept traditional Chinese medicine.""Goal realizedBrunei has a population of 412,200, the majority of whom are Malays. About 15 percent are Chinese.Before the establishment of the pharmacy, unlicensed doctors from Singapore and Taiwan were the only ones who practiced TCM in Brunei, and the broad range of treatments was obtained almost only by Chinese.Wen said the goal of attracting some Malays has been realized.The branch, located in a neat business street in the capital, looks like other Tongrentang pharmacies in China: Dozens of wooden drawers contain herbal medicines, along with well-known medicines such as White Phoenix Bolus of Black-Bone Chicken. There is a lingering scent of herbs.But a closer inspection reveals the Malay language alongside the Chinese characters for ""Tongrentang"" on the sign. There are several consulting rooms, and a Chinese doctor is usually present in one, a rare circumstance in a pharmacy. Medicines that cannot be found in China are available, too.""We made some herbal tea for flu and weight gain resulting from high living standards and the traditional diet in this affluent country,"" said Wen.There are five members of staff, including two doctors from China, working in the branch. In addition to attending a daily clinic, they offer free medical consultations. The presence of the Chinese doctors makes the pharmacy feel more like a hospital, he said.Deepen understandingAcupuncture and massage are the most popular treatments among Malays in Brunei and visiting Malaysians, according to Ran Huaming, a doctor from Beijing who worked in the branch for more than a year.The most sought-after treatments by local Muslim people are for knees, because they pray several times a day, Ran said.""In addition, they are reluctant to drink the usually bitter herbal teas and they tend to believe that treatments which do not involve taking medicine are the best,"" he said.Ran, who often used his ""just-so-so"" English to communicate with local patients to try deepen their understanding of the philosophy of TCM, said the belief that treatment without medication is good can be a misunderstanding.""Sometimes they asked me how long it would take for the traditional Chinese medicine to take effect the moment they stepped into my consulting room. I would tell them that the medicine, which is unlike Western pills, would take longer to work,"" he said. ""The fortunate thing is that most of them understood that the process would be slower.""Not expensiveCompared with the problems Ran encountered, Wen, the manager, said Beijing Tongrentang in Brunei faced some more urgent challenges.""There are people complaining about the high price of our products, but the fact is, except for the freight fee, the prices are not much higher than in China. But in a rich country, which offers free medical services to its citizens, the cost seems expensive,"" said Wen.In addition, the short-term work permits for foreigners do not allow doctors from China to develop a stable customer base, said Wen.""Brunei also doesn't issue work permits for people aged over 55, but most of the experienced Chinese doctors who would like to go abroad for a job are retired,"" he added.Wen said the company needed to carefully consider whether to open more branches in Brunei in the near future, despite their wish to do so.""We are waiting patiently to see. After all, it takes time to get to know a new region,"" he said. ""But we won't stop. Opening one Tongrentang branch overseas is not only about business, but also a matter of developing Chinese culture in the world."""
186,1187.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Province plans to regulate Chinese medicine,"The days when anyone can offer acupuncture or traditional Chinese medicine treatments are coming to an end, says Health Minister George Smitherman.Legislation will be introduced in December to regulate the centuries-old healing arts, requiring practitioners to take prescribed courses of study or pass exams to become accredited as Chinese medicine grows in popularity with all cultures.Smitherman called acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine ""an extremely useful form of alternative care that we would be foolish to ignore but irresponsible not to regulate.""There are no plans to cover acupuncture or Chinese medicine under the cash-strapped Ontario Health Insurance Plan, he added. Liberal MPP Tony Wong (Markham), who prepared a report released yesterday on the need for regulation, said there are too many health concerns to risk further delay.They include the potential for harmful reactions between western drugs and herbal treatments, plus concerns that some herbs may be toxic or of poor quality.""I've heard that on a number of occasions people have left needles inside bodies of patients. ... I've also heard patients have gotten worse after treatment,"" Wong said.About 2,000 practitioners in Ontario offer traditional Chinese medicine, which takes a holistic approach to the body and treats ailments using acupuncture, herb mixtures, diet and exercise.The hundreds of medical doctors, chiropractors, physiotherapists and other health professionals who offer acupuncture under the supervision of their regulatory bodies will also have to become officially certified.The law, expected to be passed next year, would make Ontario the second province to regulate traditional Chinese medicine, behind British Columbia. Quebec and Alberta regulate acupuncture only.The concern in Ontario is that most consumers now have no way of judging or verifying the credentials of people treating them.""Here you can train for three days and become an acupuncturist,"" said Helen Chen of Toronto, who took five years of training in her native China to become a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. ""That's unfair ... that's not so good for the whole industry.""That's why standardized training is needed for the several Ontario schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine, said Smitherman.Those standards will be set by the self-regulatory body for Chinese medicine to be established as a result of the legislation. Wong's report notes training programs now vary in length from five years to well under a year.""The biggest pitfall I see is the community coming together to set standards,"" said Heather Boon, a pharmacist and expert in alternative medicine who teaches at the University of Toronto.""This is not going to happen overnight.""Plans for the law, a Liberal promise from the 2003 election campaign, were applauded by the Chinese medicine community as a way to boost the legitimacy of their treatments.""Our practice has always been given to criticism mainly because of the lack of regulation,"" said Cedric Cheung, president of the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada.Like medical doctors under the watch of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine should be accountable to a self-regulating body and subject to discipline for violations of standards, he added.Health ministry officials will now draft the law, drawing from the Wong report, which also recommended:Different classes of practitioners be created depending on levels of education, experience and skill.Allowing existing practitioners to become accredited through assessment and testing through so-called ""grandparenting"" provisions.Some practitioners of Chinese medicine who are not fluent in English are urging the Ontario government to allow for examinations in their native language.""If this exam has to be in English, I think the only thing I can do is to give up,"" Wing Yet Chan, who came to Toronto from China 27 years ago and practises at the Wayman Herbs Centre on Spadina Ave., told the Toronto Star's Huang Naili.Smitherman said the regulation will have to be handled with ""cultural sensitivities"" in mind."
187,1188.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,The preventative benefits of traditional Chinese medicine,"Traditional Chinese medicine is usually associated with acupuncture, herbs and massage, but it encompasses much more, says Adam Chen, an acupuncture specialist and organizer of the Chinese Medicine Experience at the Telus Taiwanfest this weekend at Harbourfront Centre. Chen, who runs acupuncture clinics at Mount Sinai Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, has invited 22 other practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to provide free consultations and seminars about preventative and curative medicines.Afternoon seminars will address issues such as stroke prevention, allergy treatment and ways to manage menopause. Individual consultations start at noon and run until 8 p.m. on Aug. 24 and 6 p.m. Aug. 25.What is traditional Chinese medicine?The main idea is to prevent disease and improve wellness. It's not only about acupuncture or acupressure. It involves proper diet, certain self-massage, exercise and herbal remedies. Perfect health is relative. For example, a morning person will feel fatigued at night, and a night owl will feel sluggish in the morning. Because their body type is different, you can't use the same methods on both of them.How does traditional Chinese medicine work?Part of the concept is following nature - just as the sun rises and sets, you have to act accordingly so that you're healthy. During different seasons our body's physiological functions vary and we need to understand how to fit with the natural changes of the seasons. ... If we try to follow nature, our health will improve. The rhythm of one's life makes a huge impact on health. For instance, if you manage your stress, improve your sleep quality and have a proper diet, menopausal symptoms will naturally reduce.People think if they go to their annual checkup with the family doctor that's enough. ... However, everybody's body is like a vehicle and you need to do regular checkups and regular workouts. Not too many people understand that the body needs regular care.What illnesses can traditional Chinese medicine help prevent?It can prevent allergies by improving the immune system's function; gastric ulceration by reducing acid; heart attack by improving coronary blood flow and stroke by controlling blood flow in the brain. The World Health Organization has listed more than two dozen diseases and health conditions that are effectively treated by acupuncture. More than 90 per cent of my patients have specific diseases.Also, traditional Chinese medicine can effectively control pain, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, menstrual problems, infertility, Bell's palsy, stroke and much more.Is this done through acupuncture?Acupuncture is one method. Herbal remedies and exercise, such as Tai Chi, are also important."

Jessica Leung, 20, just found out she's been accepted into the program, which starts in September.She was inspired to apply for the program by a TCM practitioner she knows well: her dad. ""Ever since I was little I got to witness the potential of TCM because of my dad,"" she said. ""I got to see how it can really help people with critical illnesses.""Leung is wrapping up a business administration degree at the University of Toronto, which she hopes will provide transferable skills in leadership and management if she decides to open her own TCM clinic one day.""What I really liked about Humber was the amount practical clinical experience,"" she said, adding that she's excited to learn about Chinese herbology in particular. There are six mandatory clinical placements, one clinical observation and one clinical practicum to provide students with practical experience.""It's a big step for the TCM community so I'm really glad to be part of it,"" said Leung. ""I think the future is a lot brighter now - it's becoming more widely accepted in the Western community.""Thanks to factors such as immigration and access to information online, Ontarians are becoming more aware of other modalities to support their health and wellness. ""We would be remiss if we didn't support that,"" said Jason Powell, dean of the School of Health Sciences at Humber. ""There's a gap in our wish and desire to be well and what's available - we want to close that gap.""The TCM profession was regulated in 2014, which could open up more employment opportunities for future graduates. According to Service Canada, certified training programs and the trend toward alternative medicine means ""the number of practitioners of natural healing (which include Chinese medical practitioners) should rise sharply in the next few years.""There is already a ""substantial appetite"" for the TCMP program at Humber by way of applications, according to Powell.Danny Li, program advisor for TCM with Humber's School of Health Sciences, is also a TCM practitioner. Since the industry has been regulated, he's seen a huge increase in public interest - and in credibility and trust.But he points out that many of the TCM practitioners in Ontario are well over the age of 50 - and Ontario needs to start grooming the next generation.""Now we have a proper training program,"" said Li, adding that this new generation of practitioners will have higher competencies across all modalities that fall within the realm of TCM. The curriculum is being developed by an advisory committee of 14 experts from different fields to ensure diversity.""This is not a program where we're isolated to acupuncture,"" said Powell. ""We are providing education for TCM practitioners who will have an ability to implement comprehensive herbal therapy, moxibustion and all of the treatment methodologies and wellness supports.""Graduates of the program will be qualified to practice acupuncture, as well as prescribe herbal therapy. They'll also be eligible for the national examination and, upon successful completion of the exam, be licensed with the College of TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO).Humber is also planning to lead research initiatives to evaluate the efficacy of TCM as a treatment option. ""There's not an abundance of evidence that says penicillin with herbal therapy and acupuncture does this,"" said Powell. ""We want to be the ones that show the world that TCM is amazing."""

Acupuncture is one component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has a history of about 5,000 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted many scientific studies before stating, at WHO's inter-regional seminar in 1979, that acupuncture can be very effective in treating 43 different diseases.I have conducted scientific studies based on many years of clinical practice in London, Ont. It was found that the use of acupuncture, in combination with herbs and Chinese nutrition, could treat effectively 55 medical disorders.This scientific paper was presented at the world conference in Kyoto, Japan, in 1993, sponsored by WHO, the Ministry of Health of Japan, the Medical Society of Japan, and the World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion Societies (WFAS).Dr. Jean Schatz, the former president of the International Society of Acupuncture (SIA) of Paris, France, and a luminary in the field of modern health care, underscored that ""since Traditional (Chinese Medicine) and Western medicine have the same objectives to cure and relieve the human body, they should not compete, but rather complement each other.""The best interests of mankind can be served and health- care costs can be reduced by the two medicines complementing one another.

With regard to herbal remedies and acupuncture, legislation to regulate these is welcome so they can be tested for safety and to ensure sterile conditions. There is, however, another side to traditional Chinese medicine, which involves the use of animal-based ingredients. I submit that this aspect is derived mainly from superstition, eg. strength from tiger parts; male potency from seal penises and so on. It often involves abhorent cruelty to animals bred for the purpose. For instance, deplorable conditions of captivity, and execrable practices such as ""milking"" a live bear's gall bladder. Tigers have been bred specifically to be slaughtered for ""medicine"" and many of our own wild Canadian bears have been illegally killed merely to extract their gall bladders, with the rest of the body left to rot.These kinds of products should have no place in Ontario or Canada, and should be banned from being imported or sold.Yvonne Mackie, Newmarket"

For the past few years, he has been spending six hours a week studying the medical traditions of his ancestors. Wong will be among the speakers at a one-day seminar on traditional Chinese medicine Feb. 24 at Centennial College which is aimed at health care professionals and educators or members of the public who have an interest in the topic.The day will include basic theory of acupuncture, hands- on demonstrations, an introduction to Chinese herbal medicine and a look at typical herbs, and a session to try out the techniques. In addition to Wong, presenters include Chinese medical doctor Danny Li of Toronto and Dr. Zhida Tao, former president of the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, who now practises in Scarborough.Wong says there are several reasons for the increasing popularity of Chinese medicine.""For one, it works and it has a very strong historical base, with wisdoms collected over thousands of years,"" he says. ""We also have a larger Chinese population immigrating to Canada and we're getting professionals and doctors coming who are able to provide training.""Not just the Chinese population is embracing the old traditions, however.""People are becoming more knowledgeable and are appreciating traditional medicine more,"" he notes.""In the past there was little respect for traditional medicine and people had more faith in western medicine's scientific approach. Some have been through the scientific treatments and don't feel better, so they look to this as an option. And doctors who are western-trained are becoming more open-minded.""Wong, who received his medical degree from the University of Toronto, originally trained in anatomical acupuncture and finds there are merits to both ancient and modern medicine.""For instance, for a strep throat, I'd use penicillin and not Chinese herbal medicine,"" he says. ""But it is effective for certain types of high blood pressure, some forms of diabetes and chronic skin rashes and for cancer patients in the palliative care stage.""I offer traditional Chinese medicine as an option to my patients. There are some who are chronically ill, who don't want to take medication. If they are interested, I'll give them what's safe and effective.""Wong cautions patients not to rush into traditional Chinese medicine, however. The Ontario government does not regulate this form of medicine, so it is important to check out a practitioner's training and credentials first, he says.""With seminars like this one, our priority is to arouse interest and encourage them to learn about it, to encourage the government to control it and to educate the public so they will be protected,"" says Wong.The fee for the day-long training session at Centennial's Progress Campus is $106.

""The increased blood flow helps the healing process and it does get red but that doesn't last long, maybe 24 hours.""Wright suggests Paltrow may have had cupping on her upper back to treat sore or tight muscles, or for a cold or asthma.Cupping can be done with plastic cups to create suction - ""like a bicycle pump"" - or with a glass cup placed over alcohol that's been lit to create the suction.""You can also do 'moving cupping,'"" explains Wright, ""by creating that fire cup and sliding the cup. It's almost similar to receiving a massage in a way.A cupping session done by a student practitioner at the Michener Institute costs $25 ($20 for seniors and students) and a coupon for a 10 per cent summer discount is available at the Web site: www.michener.ca."

This is, in fact, a historic day which will finally allow the acupuncturists and TCM practitioners of Ontario to take their place alongside the other regulated health professions in the province. Contrary to the quotes from a vocal minority that were interviewed for this article, this bill has enjoyed widespread support both in the TCM community and the general public. It passed the support of the governing Liberal party combined with the support of the major opposition parties.This amount of support shows that it was past time for this type of legislation. Previously, there was absolutely no regulation of acupuncture and TCM in Ontario. Anybody, regardless of training or expertise, has been able to set up shop in Ontario and start performing acupuncture. There have been absolutely no standards and no monitoring to ensure that people were receiving quality treatment. No formal mechanism currently exists to hear complaints.The benefits to the public are obvious and include the assurance that providers of TCM and acupuncture meet educational and clinical standards before starting their practices and throughout their professional careers. The public will also know that we will finally be monitored by a self-regulatory body with regard to ethics, professional standards, and investigating complaints.The benefits of this legislation to the profession are also many. We will benefit from increased public confidence and a higher public profile. We will be able to establish education programs that will meet our needs. There may even be increased private insurance coverage for our treatments.Some of the issues raised in the article are flat-out errors. Bill 50 does not suddenly allow other health professionals to perform acupuncture; it limits everybody who is not a member of certain regulated health professions from performing acupuncture. And, in direct contradiction to what was reported, Bill 50 also amends the provincial Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act to ensure that natural products such as Chinese herbs are available for our profession to dispense.After this, the government will largely step back and allow the transitional College of TCM and Acupuncturists of Ontario to establish our own standards to look after the interests of the public and the profession.Instead of belated protests and rhetoric, I believe it is time for us as a profession to step forward and make the effort to work together for the betterment of the entire TCM and acupuncture community of Ontario.Jane Cheung, committee member, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada, Oshawa"

There is some vocal opposition to Bill 50 but there is strong support from much of the TCM community from a variety of sources including health consumer groups and many of the actual practitioner members of some of the groups whose leaders are so vocal in their opposition to this bill. I also have to point out that the credentials and history of Cedric Cheung, president of theChinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada, vice-president of theWorld Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion (the only acupuncture association recognized by the World Health Organization) and more than 20 years of lobbying various provincial and federal governments for the regulation of TCM and acupuncture across Canada, were notable in their absence compared to the listed credentials of the other people interviewed.The TCM community in Ontario will benefit from the passage of this bill as it will allow TCM and acupuncture to become one of the regulated health professions in Ontario. This means that TCM practitioners will be the ones establishing their college and working together to determine the practical details of ""grandfathering"" existing practitioners, establishing the new standards for the title of ""doctor"" and whether ""diagnosis"" is one of the controlled acts for which we should apply to the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Council.There is nothing in the bill that would force a TCM practitioner to change how he or she works at this time; they would still be able to assess, recommend herbs and use acupuncture on their patients. The public only stands to benefit through enhanced safety and the assurance that qualified professionals will be managing their care. Once regulation has passed, they may benefit from improved insurance access to our services.The Regulated Health Professions Act does not allow for one college to regulate the activities of the others - the college of TCM and acupuncture would not be able to mandate standards for the other professions. The existing regulated health professions already have their own colleges to ensure their members are providing quality care within their scopes of practice.Jane Cheung, member, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada, Oshawa Clinic"
197,1198.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Acupuncture visit 'painless',"    A visit to an acupuncturist consists of two main phases, diagnosis and treatment.A practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) will observe the patient's tongue, take the pulse in six or eight spots on the wrists, discretely sniff the patient's odor. A doctor trained in Western medical schools may check charts for blood work or urinalysis, ask questions relating to a patient's lifestyle and stress levels. Both will ask the patient to describe the symptoms or pain. The treatment phase begins with the acupuncturist directing the patient to uncover certain parts of the body - usually the forearms, feet, shins and torso - and to sit in a chair or recline on a bed.The practitioner will then use his or her fingertips to gently identify the points for placement of the needles. The needles are almost as fine as a hair and have rounded ends rather than the oblique and cutting points found on injection needles - so insertion is virtually painless.Because of the risk of AIDS, most acupuncturists today use sealed packets of disposable needles - insist on it.Other than the coolness of a sterilizing wipe with alcohol, the patient may be unaware of the insertion of the needles. The gentleness of the needling is where the individual acupuncturist's skill is most evident to the new patient.Traditional Japanese acupuncture uses a guide tube or straw which presses on the skin of the appropriate meridian point and within which the needle itself moves. The patient feels only the slight pressure of the guide tube.The TCM practitioner may snap a finger on the point, numbing it, before dextrously slipping the needle in. Likewise, a Western-trained acupuncturist may use local pressure before inserting the needle - the patient is often unaware of its application. At its worst - for needlephobiacs - the insertion of an acupuncture needle into the skin is no more painful than a mosquito bite, far less painful than a pin prick.Anywhere from half a dozen to a score of needles may be used, depending on the condition being treated. The length of time the needles remain in depends on the style of acupuncture being practised.TCM practitioners and Western MDs usually insert a series of needles, then clip tiny wires to the needles and hook them up to an electric stimulator. This low-intensity current electrically stimulates the acupuncture points. The patient feels a sensation around the needle that varies from a mild electric tingling to a dull ache.The needles are left in place for 20 to 30 minutes. The acupuncturist monitors the patient carefully, adjusting the current levels for comfort if electro- stimulation is used, and draping warm towels over any part of the body which feels cold.When the treatment is finished, the wires are unclipped and the needles are removed - an entirely painless procedure.Patients leave with a warm, drowsy sensation of well-being. This pleasurable feeling increases for several hours afterward.See related article p.F1"

That's the time frame - under legislation proposed yesterday - for setting up a new body regulating the ancient healing arts, setting standards for training and accreditation of more than 2,000 practitioners.""If the sign on the door says 'doctor,' patients need to know that title is backed up,"" Smitherman said before introducing the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act.Penalties for misrepresentation of qualifications will range from $5,000 to $10,000.The way things now stand in Ontario, anyone can go into business offering acupuncture or traditional Chinese medicine, including herbal therapies.""There's a lot of loose, unofficial titles out there,"" said Toronto chiropractor Dr. Kwong Chiu, who also practises acupuncture.He's one of many in the Chinese medicine community who applauded the government's move, which Smitherman and practitioners agreed will boost the credibility of fast-growing traditional Chinese medicine.But until the profession becomes self-regulating - like doctors, chiropractors and massage therapists, for example - it's up to consumers to check the background of practitioners if they have any concerns.The field is coming under regulation because of the potential for harmful reactions between western drugs and herbal treatments, concerns some herbs may be toxic or of poor quality, and fears that practitioners could cut corners on the sterilization of acupuncture needles, a problem that happened in Quebec last year, prompting officials to warn 1,100 patients to get tested for HIV and hepatitis.Smitherman said he hopes publicity surrounding his legislation will create ""a higher degree of awareness"" among patients and said acupuncture and Chinese medicine will not be covered by OHIP.There is a ""very large range"" of skills among practitioners now, with some having graduated from years of study in traditional schools in China or Canada and others who learned from elders or in weekend courses, said Mary Wu, president of the Toronto School of Traditional Chinese Medicine. ""That's why it needs to be regulated.""B.C. is the only other province to regulate acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. Alberta and Quebec regulate acupuncture only."

I have a large Asian-based practice and a lot of my patients try alternative medicine in the form of ""herbal"" medicine, acupuncture and traditional ""Chinese medicine."" I have even taken herbal medicine as a child. Although I am not a strong opponent of these forms of practices, I have seen time and time again where these treatments have failed patients. They always end up coming to me for further treatments.I have seen patients take herbal medicine for diabetes, hypertension and even cancer, and, almost always, their illness becomes worse than when I was treating them. Some of my patients have lost their lives because they stopped their Western medicine, much to my opposition.Since they have to pay for the treatment out of their own pockets, it does not cost the taxpayers; however, that does not justify the treatments. In some cases, I have seen patients travel as far as Mexico to receive ""natural treatments"" for their cancer, costing them $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 U.S. And they were not cured.I believe it is our (the medical profession's) duty to also educate and protect our patients. I believe that unless there is strong scientific based evidence, every other treatment is anecdotal.Cherry writes about Bill 126, but unfortunately, by the time the evidence that proves that the therapy posed a greater risk to a patient's health comes to light, it is often too late to treat that patient with Western medicine.I think there is a place for these types of treatments but, without strong regulation, I am afraid that, more often than not, the patients are at risk.

It is a 'valued health option,' the premier says.","Traditional Chinese medicine therapies are important health options that could eventually be covered by medicare, Premier Glen Clark said Monday.The premier made the prediction after announcing that B.C. will become the first province to regulate the full range of Chinese medicine therapies -- including such treatments as acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, rehabilitation exercise, energy control therapy and some forms of exercise, such as shadow boxing, which includes tai chi.A new governing body, to be called the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Practitioners of B.C., will also be established to oversee traditional Chinese medical practitioners, including acupuncturists.The college is expected to set minimum standards of education among practitioners to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment. ''By regulating traditional Chinese medicine, the provincial government recognizes it as an important and valued health option in our society,'' added Clark. ''I'm proud B.C. has taken this important step.''''I think (medicare coverage) is a logical progression once (we) recognize it as a legitimate form of medicine. The more emphasis we put on wellness, the more money we save in acute care.''Clark couldn't say when it could be included under medicare, only that such coverage would be predicated on, among other things, cost and public acceptance.The government decision to regulate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on recommendations made by the Health Professions Council. Cabinet is expected to give final approval to the proposed amendments following a three-month consultation process, as required by the Health Professions Act.Health Minister Penny Priddy, who was also on hand for the announcement in front of dozens of Chinese medicine providers, said the use of traditional Chinese medicine is growing throughout the province.''This decision recognizes the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine and gives practitioners here the legal authority to do what has been done elsewhere for thousands of years.''This is an excellent example of our commitment to providing a health-care system that incorporates the best health-care practices -- both old and new.''Mason Loh, past chair of the board of the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (SUCCESS), called Monday's announcement far-sighted.''Traditional Chinese medicine has been practised for thousands of years and is used by more than a billion people in China and elsewhere in the world,'' Loh said. ''I am also glad to see the government has taken the action necessary for acupuncturists to be licensed.''Loh will chair the college's new nine-member board of directors.James Knights, president of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association of B.C., called Monday's announcement a great boost.''This is tremendous for the people of B.C. and for our profession. The government has recognized the importance of regulating the vast treasure house of (traditional Chinese medicine) as a health profession for the benefit of the public.''This paves the way for an integration of TCM into mainstream health care so British Columbians can benefit from the two primary forms of health care that complement each other.''Knights said regulation means there will be better educational standards.''Without regulation, it (is) just a loose form of professional associations. There have been problems identifying educational backgrounds in the past. This will set standards of practice, so everyone has a certain minimum standard.''Knights said the new regulatory body will likely mean higher costs for practitioners, which could be passed on to patients.''But it shouldn't be high, because it would be spread out over a (large) number of patients.''Knights said he and other practitioners had initial concerns that regulating TCM might mean coming under the control of traditional medicine. He said Monday's announcement clears up those concerns.Knights said TCM focuses on preventing disease. ''We don't expect (medicare coverage) anytime soon, but it would be a money-saving issue.''It's very focused on prevention. The more people you keep out of hospital, the more money you save.''Morris Van Andel, deputy-registrar of the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons, agreed that regulation is a good idea.''The standards imposed on orthodox physicians are significant. I would hope those same high standards will apply.''Van Andel said the college has no position on whether traditional medicine should be covered by medicare.''But as a taxpayer, I hope that money (would) be spent wisely.''There's currently a fiscal crunch in health care.

203,1204.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,The intricacies of acupuncture,"Q: What is acupuncture?A: Acupuncture is usually used as a complement to traditional Chinese medicine. It involves inserting stainless steel needles - really thin stainless steel wires - into traditional acupuncture points. The theory is that acupuncture unblocks and rebalances the flow of energy, or Qi, through the body. The modern practice of medical acupuncture - as practised by medical doctors - uses wires inserted into known anatomical structures rather than points dictated by ancient philosophy or astrology.Q: What are the educational and training requirements to qualify to practise?A: Training in traditional acupuncture usually lasts three years and can only be under-taken after two years of university-level science. A fully qualified practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine studies for up to five years, after two years of university-level science. B.C. is home to several training schools for acupuncturists.Q: Who certifies and regulates acupuncturists: private body, or provincial or federal government?A: All practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine are regulated by the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of B.C., a self-governing body not totally unlike those that regulate doctors and nurses. In B.C., acupuncturists are licensed by the provincial government.Acceptable treatments are defined by the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners.Q: What can an acupuncturist do for you?A: Traditional Chinese acupuncture is used to prevent disease, pain, infertility and to promote general health. The modern practice of medical acupuncture is mainly used to treat pain and nausea. British Columbia is the only province in Canada to fund acupuncture treatments through the Medical Services Plan.Q: Can an acupuncturist pre-scribe drugs? What are some typical remedies?A: Acupuncture is often used with massage and herbal remedies that may also have real benefits for some medical conditions. Acupuncture is also being used in the conventional medical system as a way to curb nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, according to the B.C. Qualified Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association.Q: What kinds of claims are made about the effectiveness of acupuncture treatments and remedies?A: The effectiveness of acupuncture is very much in question, but there is no doubt that it has fans, including professional athletes. Some studies have found acupuncture to be effective as a treatment for headaches as well as neck and back pain. A lot of other studies have found little evidence that acupuncture is effective for much else, and bodies from the National Council Against Health Fraud to the American Medical Association maintain that acupuncture is not an effective treatment for any disease.Q: How do I check the performance or disciplinary history of my acupuncturist?A: You can use the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of B.C. website (ctcma.bc.ca) to find out if an acupuncturist is registered as a qualified practitioner with the college.Q: Who disciplines transgressors?A: CTCMA defines accept-able practices and disciplines those who violate the rules.Complaints about the conduct of an acupuncturist should be directed to the college.Sources: Medical Services Plan of B.C., Traditional Chinese Medicine Association B.C."

Court of Appeal has ordered him reinstated. ""This amounts to a denial of procedural fairness,"" Justice Ian Donald wrote in a unanimous decision.Wong is entitled to reinstatement with full back pay and benefits, less income from other employment earned in the meantime, he wrote.The College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of B.C. was formed in 1996 to govern the previously unregulated traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture profession.Wong came to the college with solid credentials as former chief executive officer of Mission Memorial Hospital in the Fraser Valley.However, concerns about his performance as college registrar began in 2000 when he was ordered by the college board of directors to implement an accounting system.Without it, the college could not produce required financial statements.Wong refused to do so even when an auditor provided him with an accounting system in September, 2002.Frustrated, in October, 2003, the board ordered an external audit and met with Wong to point out the shortcomings in his performance.""Wong promised to correct these matters and to cooperate with the board,"" the court ruling states.Still nothing changed.When the audit was released in November, it pointed out financial irregularities exceeding $50,000.Wong was accused of improperly charging overtime pay and vacation pay and reimbursing himself for expenses he had no right to claim.The allegations against Wong were laid out in a dismissal letter that ordered him to never set foot in the college.Wong argued that although he was aware there were issues with his day-to-day management of the college, he was never led to believe his job was in jeopardy.The appeal court judges agreed.""As Wong correctly submits, prior to his termination, the college went no further than to reprimand him with regard to complaints and gave no ultimatum or other indication that they were on the verge of firing him.""Wong never saw the (audit ) report before he was fired nor was he given any inkling that he was under suspicion of dishonesty.""Wong's lawyer said the largest of the allegedly improper claims ($47,000) singled out in the audit depended on the accountant's interpretation of Wong's employment contract, which could have been misconstrued.Donald ruled Wong should be reinstated and allowed to defend his case before the college's board of directors.The college balked at the prospect.A replacement had been hired long ago and the relationship between Wong and college was so poisoned that bringing him back would be unduly disruptive, the college's lawyer argued.Donald said there was no need to bring Wong back into active service. Merely putting him back on the payroll would be incentive enough to insure that he would be quickly granted a fair hearing.atanner@png.canwest.com"
205,1206.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Pinpointing pain relief; Study extols benefits of acupuncture,"NEW YORK -- Acupuncture, as practised in traditional Chinese medicine, may offer some relief from migraine pain, a new study suggests.Italian researchers found that regular treatments with ""true"" acupuncture helped improve symptoms in 32 patients whose migraines had been resistant to standard preventive medication. Moreover, the therapy worked better than two forms of ""sham"" acupuncture used for comparison, the researchers reported in the medical journal Headache.Past studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether acupuncture can aid in migraine treatment. Some research has suggested that sham acupuncture, using blunted needles that do not pierce the skin, is as likely to bring relief as is the real therapy -- calling into question the actual biological effects of acupuncture.However, a problem with this research is that studies have had inconsistent designs, and many have used acupuncture points that are ""inappropriate"" based on Chinese medicine, according to the authors of the new study.Acupuncture has been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments.According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (pronounced ""chee""), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.For the current study, Dr. Enrico Facco of the University of Padua and his colleagues looked at how traditionally performed acupuncture stood up against two sham forms for preventing migraines.They randomly assigned 160 migraine sufferers to one of four groups:- In one, patients received twice-weekly sessions of acupuncture using traditional acupuncture points;- A second group received sham acupuncture as it is usually performed in studies;- A third group also underwent sham acupuncture, but with the blunted needles touching traditional acupuncture points;- The fourth served as a control group, in which patients received no acupuncture or preventive medication.The participants in all the groups were given medication to treat any migraine attacks.Over six months, Facco's team found, only the group receiving true, traditional acupuncture showed lasting improvement in migraine disability measured on a standardized scale, compared with the control group.The ""main novelty"" of the study, Facco said, is that the therapy was based on traditional Chinese medicine, but studied using the modern or Western scientific method.The results are promising, he said, but more studies are needed to confirm the benefits of traditional acupuncture for migraine.However, Facco added, since the therapy carries little risk of side effects, it could be worth a try for migraine sufferers who are not adequately helped by standard preventive treatment.It's still not completely clear why acupuncture might help ease migraine pain.In addition to the traditional theories on qi, modern research has suggested that acupuncture may work by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system."

From July 18 to Aug. 17 is the best time for the treatment of asthma in the whole year,"" Ma said. Her poultices don't feel hot to the touch but when she tapes them to an asthma patient's back and leaves them there for two hours they produce a burning sensation.""That means all of the poisons come out and the channels are open,"" Ma said.Traditional Chinese medicine posits that qi, or vital energy, courses through 14 channels in the body. Illnesses are seen as evidence that one or more channels are blocked.Growing up in China, Ma had asthma that grew increasingly severe in her teen years. She relied heavily on Western drugs, such as antibiotics, allergy shots, prednisone (an oral steroid) and inhalers.After earning her medical degree, with training in both the Chinese and the Western systems, she tried the traditional Chinese treatment for asthma -- herbal poultices in the summer, augmented by frequent acupuncture treatments.She says it has alleviated her asthma, although she helps by strictly avoiding dust, pollen and dietary triggers.Ma came to Canada four years ago and set up an acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine practice. She has about 15 patients with respiratory ailments.Working according to the Chinese calendar, she gives poultice treatments in the summer. She places the poultices on the acupuncture points that relate to the lung, spleen and kidney channels.On a subsequent visit she inserts acupuncture needles into selected points to ease difficulty in breathing, relieve stress and improve patients' all-round physical condition.She charges $ 42 for an acupuncture session and $ 45 for the poultices.Her patients will have to continue paying for treatments. Victoria recently granted acupuncture the status of a self-governing health profession but treatments won't be covered by the Medical Services Plan.Western medicine knows little about using acupuncture, let alone herbal poultices, for asthma.The B.C. Medical Association says consumers have the right to visit alternative health practitioners but it doesn't support therapies that aren't backed by scientific evidence of benefit.Dr. Moira Yeung, a chest physician in Vancouver Hospital's respiratory division, said: ""I am not familiar with this type of medicine and I doubt very much it has been tried out in a scientific manner.""Yeung said it is not enough for people who receive traditional Chinese treatment to say they feel better.""You really should have objective measures, such as breathing-test results"" and controlled clinical trials, Yeung said.Some of Ma's asthma patients say her treatments have helped them greatly.Maria Furstenwald, a retired University of B.C. professor, has had chronic bronchitis and asthma for decades. She said she used to be incapacitated in the spring when the air is full of pollen. ""I could hardly get a breath.""Furstenwald, 70, has had numerous poultice treatments. Ma puts them on nine points, from her neck to her lower back.It hurts -- ""I'm pretty burned now,"" Furstenwald said -- but it has helped. She said she survives the pollen season with a minimum of discomfort and the gain outweighs the pain.Mary Watterson, president of the Acupuncture Association of B.C., sees acupuncture as a complement to conventional asthma treatment, rather than a replacement for it.""One of the words you never want to use is 'cure,' "" she said.Watterson said some scientific studies of acupuncture for asthma have been done.The British medical journal Lancet published one study from England and another from Hong Kong in 1986. An accompanying editorial acknowledged that chest physicians would have a hard time reproducing the experiments. ""Part of the [acupuncture] method is a mystery,"" it said.Watterson said acupuncture can help patients who take Western drugs for asthma by giving them better symptom control and reducing their need for medication."

Her 10-year-old mutt, Maggie, was starting to feel the effects of aging. Maggie was suffering from back pain and was sensitive to touch so Robinson took her into Amherst Veterinary Hospital for acupuncture. ""It was really cool to watch. She was not uncomfortable at all. She was super relaxed letting the doctor do whatever she wanted with the needles.""Robinson said before the treatment, Maggie - who is a retriever and border collie cross - would flinch when her back was touched but afterwards she didn't recoil at all and was able to walk up the stairs more easily.Pet owners like Robinson are increasingly turning to alternative health care solutions in a pet health industry that continues to grow each year.More than half (55 per cent) of Americans say they are willing to spend whatever it takes to maintain their pets' health, and two-fifths believe preventive health care is a must, according to a recent report by Mintel, a global market research company.In a report published last March, Mintel found pet owners are demanding quality in pet health care and better food choices to help maintain their pets' health. Pet food took thebiggest share of pet-related retail sales in 2012 at 39 per cent ($19.7 billion), followed by veterinarian services at 24 per cent.The pet industry grew slightly above the GDP growth rates, rising at an average annual growth rate of 2.8 per cent versus 2.3 per cent from 2007-12, totalling $50.5 billion in 2012 and Mintel is predicting the industry will have a 2.9 per cent average annual growth rate, reaching nearly $58.2 billion in 2017.Statistics Canada does not collect data on how much Canadians spend on their pets, but our spending habits would parallel our neighbours to the south, said Cornish.""Pet owners are willing to spend money on their pets even in the face of financial uncertainty because of the emotional connection between them,"" the Mintel report states.In British Columbia, more and more veterinarians are expanding their practices beyond the basics and offering specialty services.""Pet owners are seeing their pets as family members and are looking for options,"" Cornish says.She says in the last 20 years veterinary medicine has seen a significant growth in specialists. In B.C. there are now 60 specialists in a field of 1,250 veterinarians provincewide.When Vancouver veterinarian Dr. Michael Goldberg, of the Animal Wellness Hospital, started his practice 15 years ago, he did conventional medicine only. But by 1999 Goldberg was doing homoeopathy on animals, and in 2005 included acupuncture, chiropractic medicine and laser therapy for animals.""It's what the consumer is demanding - a more integrated approach,"" said Goldberg. ""They want their pet to feel better and not suffer and there may be two or three ways for that to happen. Say I have a dog that comes in with a certain set of symptoms associated with back pain. Ninety per cent of the time a strong anti-inflammatory (prescribed with conventional veterinary medicine) was given, but the advantage I find is if we see the same case rather than give the one choice, we can look at the spine and give a treatment option or two, either with an acupuncturist or a chiropractor and get at the root cause of that pain,"" he said.However, one of the main issues today is ensuring the people providing the alternative treatments to animals are properly qualified to do so.In B.C. the provincial Veterinary Act clearly sets out who is licensed to provide health care to animals, but the College of Veterinarians of B.C. is finding people not qualified to practice are getting into the field.Recently, the college struck an unauthorized practice committee to look into non-veterinarians encroaching on their field.""It's an increasing issue,"" Cornish says. ""You'll tend to see human practitioners branching out to animals. That is against the Veterinary Act.""She said the worst culprits are chiropractors for humans working on animals, and people who have no credentials at all performing teeth cleaning, which is under the umbrella of dental veterinary work.""You just look online, in classified ads or pet expos, to see how many are doing it,"" she said.Cornish said there is a place for alternative health practices - such as Chinese traditional medicine, homoeopathy and chiropractic care - but they must be under the supervision of a veterinarian or be done by a vet who has had the proper training.Goldberg said in order to have the right to provide chiropractic medicine for animals himself he did an additional 200 hours of training, which took six months.He did the same amount of training to learn acupuncture for animals and to learn homoeopathy.""It's amazing how things have changed since I first became a veterinarian. It's all based on how we can better treat our animals and that's how medicine grows,"" he said.""It's all mirroring human health. People are seeking out better treatments and the response of the industry is to train people to fill that demand. It's exciting to keep learning and exciting to have answers to help your patient feel better.""Cornish said it takes about four years to become a veterinarian and then, on average, another four years to become a specialist in a field such as oncology or animal dentistry. The vet would then need to write qualifying exams in that field and be certified by the college in order to practice.Specialized treatment Often vets must travel outside the province to get the training they need.For instance, veterinarian Dr. Nina Speyer, who performs acupuncture on animals at the Amherst Veterinary Hospital, obtained her certification from Colorado State University earlier this year.Speyer said the principles used in acupuncture for humans are the same for animals.""The main difference is with animals you can't leave them alone in a room with needles,"" she said.Speyer said acupuncture has been performed on animals in the mainstream only for the last 15 years.She added that while it is used on horses and exotic pets she sees mainly dogs and cats suffering from pain or inflammation in her own practice. After a conventional medical examination and diagnosis, acupuncture can be used in addition to other treatments, she said. \ It involves placing needles at specific points to induce the release of certain neurotransmitters that can block pain and reduce inflammation.Acupuncture and chiropractic medicine are such useful techniques that they can prevent animals from having to undergo surgery, said Dr. David Lane, who is trained in both methods.Lane, who has been a veterinarian since 1992, got into chiropractic medicine in 2006, in part after witnessing the results in a horse.""It was always a miserable, ornery horse. But when I saw it (one time) it was a completely different horse and I asked what happened. A chiropractor (vet) adjusted its back. Itwas behaving that way before because it was in chronic pain,"" he said.Lane said chiropractic medicine is one of his ""best tools"" to help a patient suffering from muscular skeletal pains.""We'll get a dog brought in on a board screaming in pain and 15 minutes later (after an adjustment) running around happy.""He said the demand for chiropractic medicine is huge and he has a one-month waiting time for patients in Vancouver, which is why many of his urban patients end up visiting him inSquamish and Whistler, where he also practises.Sports medicine ""The agility people with competition dogs are all over this. They're very aware of sports injuries and very proactive about their high-end competition dogs,"" he said.Lane was the team veterinarian for the Canadian National Agility Team at the World Agility Open last March in Spain. The Canadian dogs took six out of 13 gold medals.""My hotel room was turned into a treatment area to get them into top form. There was one competitor who had dropped three or four bars (during an agility course) and I could see the dog wasn't fully extending (its legs) and had lower back pain from weak underlying muscles.""After an adjustment was made the dog went on to finish the competition and only dropped one bar for the rest of the day.He said geriatric animals are often brought in for chiropractic and acupuncture treatmentsto help their muscle tone and stimulate the nerves.""We can at least stop the decline and make them more happy in their last years,"" he said.Lane said in a typical case, a dog who had a bad fall and then wasn't moving right afterwards could have his issue resolved after two or three chiro appointments costing $400 to $500 in total.He pointed out that cost would be significantly lower than if the animal had to have X-rays (which wouldn't even show the problem if it was muscular), surgery and medication.As for medical insurance for pets, Goldberg said just as with humans, coverage for alternative treatments depends on the insurance agency.""Most pet insurance companies will cover conventional medical specialties like radiology or ophthalmology but when it comes to alternatives like Chinese medicine, acupuncture or homoeopathy, some of the insurance companies are stickier. It mirrors our human medical model. It can be difficult to find coverage under MSP (Medical Service Plan) for an acupuncturist,"" he said.Despite the uncertainty surrounding pet insurance, public attitudes toward alternative treatments are changing, even if some pet owners don't want to admit it, said Lane.He gave the example of two of his clients - farmers who are neighbours - who are using his chiropractic services but would never admit that to each other.""Pets are family members. They're not just the old farm dog anymore. These old-school farmers are almost embarrassed they are bringing in their dogs to me but they're doing it because they see it works.""kpemberton@vancouversun.comThe evolution of pet food - from table scraps to the raw food dietA generation ago it wasn't uncommon for pet owners to simply feed their pets table scraps.But no more. Now only the very best highend pet food will suffice for the vast majority of pets.According to a recent report by Mintel, an international market research company, nine out of 10 pet owners view their pet as ""family members"" and as such seek only the very best pet food to ensure their pets' good health.In fact, the pet food industry comprises the biggest share of pet-related retail sales, making up nearly 40 per cent of the total amount spent on pets at $19.7 billion in 2012, according to the U.S. report (similar statistics in Canada are not available). ""Anthropomorphism of pets has an increased effect on the dietary aspects of commercial pet foods including ingredient selection and nutritional composition,"" said animal science researcher Kelly Swanson of the University of Illinois.He said the raw food diet has become increasingly popular in recent years, since some pet owners no longer accept animal byproducts in their pet foodsand are insisting on real meat. This has an impact on sustainability since ""pet foods compete now directly with human consumption.""""Homemade diets and raw feeding is using human foods. A pork chop or steak for your pet is different from a secondary product,"" said Swanson. He added that obesity among pets is a risk on a raw diet because the animal's protein intake is often significantly higher than what is required. And it's not just the raw diet fad where pets are at risk for obesity, he said.""More and more companies are selling products that have more protein and that can lead to obesity.""Swanson said some diets have 40 to 60 per cent protein with a few even advertising in the 90 per cent range, yet most dogs or cats only require 30 per cent of their diet to be protein. ""The raw food diet is fairly controversial. I have friends who feed their pets raw food and their pets are fine. But it's a trickything to do and people forget about the issue of sustainability. They'll recycle their cans on one hand but food shortages in some countries are not on their radar when they are dealing with their pets' food.""Swanson said if you are looking at this issue from a sustainability standpoint it is far better to feed your pets animal byproducts, which can still be a good protein source.Vancouver animal behaviourist Dr. Rebecca Ledger said she's found that if an animal's protein levels are too high there can be increase in aggression. She also recognizes the raw food diet is controversial among pet owners but 99 per cent of scientists ""are on the same page"" and don't believe it is appropriate.""Dogs are living longer, healthier lives because of how much healthier the dry kibble diets are now from reputable food manufacturers,"" she said.Ledger said people sometimes equate expensive pet food with the best but that's not always the case and pet owners need to read the ingredient list to ensure the diet is balanced.Kim Pemberton, Vancouver SunPet food history 1860s and 1870s - James Spratt sells first dog food, called ""dog cakes,"" in 1866 in London, England. In 1870, he introduces them in the United States. 1908 - Milk-Bone enters the market. From that period, up until 1920 there are only two food companies in the market. 1920s and 1930s - Canned horse meat is sold for pet food. 1940s - Not much changed in the industry, but war and societal changes altered perceptions of pets, with people increasingly viewing them as companions. 1950s - Purina begins extruding pet foods in 1954, a process that revolutionized the industry. This form of processing improved the product and how it was digested by pets. (Most dry foods today are extruded.) 1950s to 1980s - A lot of research is done with the goal of identifying nutrient requirements. Foods before this time were not necessarily ""complete and balanced.""1980s to today - The modern pet food industry sees a great expansion of pet food types for life stages, activity levels, and allergies.Kim Pemberton, Vancouver Sun"
208,1209.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mind and body linked,"For more than five thousand years, the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has reflected the understanding that the health of the body and the mind are inextricably linked.Although many of us may identify Chinese medicine with acupuncture and exotic-smelling herbs, these are only two aspects of a system that also includes massage and manipulations, diet therapy and therapeutic exercises such as tai chi and Qi gong (energy manipulation). Meditation and a balanced lifestyle are also considered important.Chinese medical philosophy emphasizes health of the whole body as opposed to separate parts. The foundation of this teaching lies in what the Chinese call ''Qi'' (pronounced chee) the life force or energy, that binds all things together.According to these ancient practices Qi energy flows like electricity throughout the human body, along channels or meridians, to specific organs.When all the meridians are open and functioning fully, there is an abundance of Qi and the person will enjoy good health. If one of the meridians becomes blocked, Qi cannot nourish that area of the body, and an imbalance will occur in certain organs.Even normal day-to-day living takes its toll upon our Qi, and the physical and mental effects become more apparent as we age.But the theory is that when Qi is cultivated in the body, youthful health and energy may be maintained well into old age. Longevity is also believed to be a benefit.TCM practitioners maintain that there are essentially two types of internal stress and both have a strong effect on the flow of Qi throughout the body, and hence upon physical health.Most of us are aware of the negative impact of distress upon the body; when we become anxious or angry, it is often accompanied by headaches sleeplessness, or reduced immunity function. What we may not know is that eustress, or positive excitement, such as that caused by a new job or an upcoming holiday, can also affect health.North Americans are increasingly embracing TCM as a solution to their stress as well as an answer to health problems that Western Medicine may have been unable to cure.At the Integrated Traditional Chinese Health Clinic on West Broadway in Vancouver, doctors have given thousands of patients relief from serious health problems and chronic pain.The Clinic is headed by Dr. David Bo Zhong, Acupuncture Specialist, Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong master.Dr. Zhong has extensive training in TCM, including degrees from two of China's top universities. He continues to develop his expertise by regular visits to China conferring with Masters there.Consultations with Dr. Zhong are free.There are five TCM doctors, a TCM practitioner and an herbalist supporting Dr. Zhong at the clinic.Dr. Zhong began his training under Buddhist and Taoist Masters at a Shaolin Temple in China.His parents sent him there at the age of five in hopes that he would overcome his serious liver problems and asthma.He not only regained his health but after ten years of study and training in the temple, he mastered Qigong, Taiji, Kung fu and other Traditional Chinese Arts.He attended the top two universities in China where he studied acupuncture, acupressure and herbology and completed a five year program especially for muscle and tissue rehabilitation in bodily injury cases earning his Medical Doctorate. He was a major doctor at the National Integrated Health Clinic treating chronic medical conditions which could not be treated in other hospitals.He was a guest Professor at Ball State University, Indiana by special invitation of the United States government and was an instructor at the World Acupuncture Organization in Beijing.Dr. Zhong is currently President of the International Acupuncture Association in North America, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.The World Health Organization recognizes acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine's ability to treat more than 200 commonly encountered clinical disorders including: gastrointestinal disorders, urogenital disorders, gynecological disorders, respiratory disorders, disorders of the bones, muscles, joints and nervous system, circulatory disease, emotional and psychological disorders, addictions, eye, ear, nose and throat disorders. It is also recognised as supportive therapy for many chronic and painful debilitating disorders."

210,1211.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Two health traditions stronger than one,"I wish to respond to the June 24 News in Context article, ''Keeping alternative medicine in good health.''The proper name of the new regulatory body is the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Acupuncture Practitioners of B.C. The majority of the practitioner-members of the new board are doctors of TCM who will be writing bylaws to fulfil the health professions council recommendations. These bylaws will make TCM herbology, TCM acupuncture and, most important, TCM diagnostics reserved acts for TCM practitioners.New appointee David Li Lam's comments about medical doctors leading the way makes one wonder if he truly is an alternative practitioner. It is because of the narrow path that the medical system has chosen that people seek alternatives. A Taoist system of medicine like TCM has not and would not create races of ''super-bugs'' by initiating a vicious cycle of chemical warfare that results in mutated species of bacteria. Blindly relying on reductionist methods of laboratory medicine without a universal strategy is malpractice.TCM is a clinically proven discipline. In China, it is used in combination with Western medicine to achieve a greater effect than either one used alone. Its inclusion under medicare would save money through low-cost solutions to health problems.This should be a time to accurately inform the public of a truly historical event, not use it to dash the hopes of cancer survivors, undermine premiers, wallow in hyperbole of threatened crackdowns, or to imply that the medical competence and motives of healers from other cultures are suspect or inferior.James KnightsPresidentTraditional Chinese Medicine Association of B.C, Victoria"

212,1213.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,The new face of health care; B.C. set an example for the Western world last month by licensing doctors of traditional Chinese medicine. ALEXANDRA GILL goes under the needle to check out a popular new treatment: 'facial rejuvenation'," An acupuncture facelift looks far more painful than it actually is. Or at least that's what I keep telling myself as the doctor pokes another needle in my ear. Ouch!  This ancient Chinese beauty treatment requires nearly 100 needles, far more than the dozen or so used for most acupuncture. It is also nearly twice as expensive ($120 per session) and time-consuming (1.5 hours). But the results of a 12-treatment series - reduced wrinkles, firmer muscle tone, improved collagen production and circulation - are supposed to be better than Botox.  Each year, thousands of Canadians turn to acupuncture as an alternative treatment for everything from migraines to multiple sclerosis. But as the ancient healing art becomes ever more mainstream, many are now discovering that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)has cosmetic applications as well.  Last month, British Columbia became the first province in Canada (and the first jurisdiction in the western world) to confer professional status - and responsibility - on the full sweep of traditional Chinese therapies.   Acupuncture has been regulated in B.C. since 1999 (and is also regulated in Alberta and Quebec). But under the new legislation, all TCM practitioners - including acupuncturists and those who work with medicinal herbs, energy-control therapy and rehabilitation exercises such as qigong - must now be licensed by the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupunc- turists, a self-regulatory body created by the provincial government three years ago.  ""This is one of our prouder moments,"" says Sindi Hawkins, B.C.'s minister of Health Planning, who presided over the licensing ceremony in Vancouver. ""This is a profession from Eastern medicine that's more than 4,000 years old and we're the first jurisdiction in the West to recognize it. People here wanted that choice. We wanted to ensure they had a safe, quality choice.""  Chinese medicine isn't covered in the province's medical services plan, although a growing number of private extended health plans now include it.  The 392 practitioners who received licences at the June ceremony will be regulated in much the same way as physicians, nurses and massage therapists. They must complete specific education requirements and a series of safety courses, pass licensing examinations, carry at least $1-million in malpractice insurance and meet professional conduct standards.  More than half - 230 - were licensed as Doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine. (The other titles granted were Registered Acupuncturist, Registered TCM Practitioner and Registered TCM Herbalist.)  The doctors, who are trained in the entire panoply of traditional Chinese therapies, must prove that they have completed five years of TCM education at a recognized institute. (Practitioners must study for four years, while acupuncturists and herbalists need three years of study.)  Dr. Tahmineh Nikookar is one of these newly licensed doctors. Born in Iran, with a master's degree in chemical engineering, she became interested in Chinese medicine after her husband had acupuncture to treat a shoulder problem. The results, says Dr. Nikookar, were amazing. She became fascinated with the philosophy, and studied at the Tai Shan medical college in China, where she received a degree in Chinese medicine, and at the Canadian College of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in Victoria, where she obtained a diploma in herbology.  Since starting her Vancouver practice in 1995, Dr. Nikookar has become one of the few Canadian practitioners of Chinese medicine to specialize in facial rejuvenation. She says the procedure - which combines acupuncture, energy work and herbs - is thousands of years old but went out of fashion in China when the Communists came to power.  Vanity may be the primary reason her clients see her, but Dr. Nikookar says the procedure is more than just cosmetic. ""It treats the whole body, from the inside out."" As with all Chinese therapies, facial rejuvenation is based on the principle of chi, the invisible vital energy that, according to traditional Chinese medicine, flows through organs and along internal pathways, or meridians.  Using energy work, herbal creams and dozens of acupuncture needles, some so tiny they must be handled with tweezers, the procedure helps stimulate the smooth circulation of energy throughout the body, with an emphasis on the face, and improve natural collagen production. A series of at least seven treatments is recommended in order to attain the full benefits, which could include firmer facial muscles, tighter pores, the reduction of fine lines, brighter eyes and glowing skin.  Before we get started with the needles, she takes me through a series of questions about my medical history. Dr. Nikookar will not treat people with high blood pressure. ""It brings all the yang to the head."" Nor will she treat anyone who has had prior facial plastic surgery. ""In case something has gone wrong and I get blamed.""  She inspects my tongue, takes my pulse and asks me to remove my clothes and lie down under a sheet on the examination table.  ""Close your eyes,"" she instructs, as she waves a small wooden pendulum over the length of my body to check my energy flow. I take a quick peek, and see it wobbling erratically over my stomach.  ""You are very unbalanced,"" Dr. Nikookar sighs.  Most of Dr. Nikookar's patients find her through an ad in the Yellow Pages, or through word of mouth. Luckily for them, she is skilled and highly qualified. Not everyone is so fortunate. You might recall the Toronto acupuncture clinic that was closed down last winter after more than 20 patients were infected with a rare skin disease. That sort of scenario is far less likely to happen in B.C., now that province-wide standards ensure that practitioners abide by proper infection-control practices.  Of the 554 practitioners who applied for the new licences, 162 were denied. Sixteen of the failed applicants had tried to pass off fraudulent credentials.  If patients encounter unsafe or improper conduct, they can lodge a complaint with the College.  The professional designation of TCM in B.C. could set a precedent for other provinces. In Alberta, the Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine has submitted an application for regulation to the Health Professions Advisory Board, which is now studying the proposal before making recommendations.  Ontario may be slower to follow. In a recent report to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario expressed ""strong reservations"" about the creation of a self-regulatory body for TCM, although it supports the practice of acupuncture as a treatment for pain.  ""I know the world is watching us,"" says Ms. Hawkins. ""I think that it's important for other governments in Canada to consider what we've done. I think they'll see that this balance of east meets west can co-exist and complement one another.""  Western medicine is comparable to sending in a SWAT team, says Dr. Randy Wong, registrar of the B.C. College and former chief executive officer of Mission Memorial Hospital.  ""Eastern medicine, for lack of a better analogy, is more like sending in a social worker. The situation is diffused, and work is done on the root causes of illness so you can address the problem before having to send in a SWAT team to blow it away.""  Dr. Wong agrees that a SWAT team is still sometimes needed. But he insists the two schools of medicine can be complementary.  ""It all goes back to the ancient philosophy of Chinese medicine, which aims to restore the body's balance. If your body is balanced, you can live to a ripe old age. It won't make a 50-year-old man look 18 again, but it can help restore your energy.""  One Vancouver woman swears her facial acupuncture worked wonders. The 58-year-old artist, who asked that her name not be published because she hasn't told any of her friends about the procedure, began seeing Dr. Nikookar for facial treatments last year. She wanted to do something about the fine lines around her eyes. ""But I didn't want my face cut with a knife,"" she explains.  She says she began seeing results after the first visit. She carried through with a series of 15 treatments, and now continues to see Dr. Nikookar for maintenance sessions every month and uses her herbal cleansers and face creams daily. The difference in her appearance, she says, is night and day.  ""My skin is tighter. I don't have jowls anymore - and no crow's feet. My eyelids are firmer. And the little lines around my lips are gone. My skin tone is much brighter. I don't even wear makeup anymore. It's amazing what she can do.""  Despite her positive experience, she says her friends wouldn't understand why she's doing it. ""[Chinese medicine] is becoming more popular, but a lot of people are still skeptical.""  I'm skeptical too, as I lie on the examination table in the dark feeling like a human pincushion. Dr. Nikookar has pierced nearly 100 needles into my head, face, hands, legs and feet. And now she's left me alone to let the energy start flowing.  The needles are supposed to help me relax, but I feel restless. When Dr. Nikookar comes back five minutes later to check on me, I tell her the needles don't hurt, but it feels as though all the tension in my body has gone straight to my backside.  The concerned look on her face is not comforting. She rubs her hands together, stretches out her palms and begins slowly waving them across my body. ""There is a big blockage here,"" she says, pausing above my abdomen. She goes to work on the area, trying to draw out the tension with her hands.  Suddenly, my body responds and starts lifting up toward her hands. I swear I'm not controlling it. I peer down my nose past pins the size of walrus tusks and watch as she continues doing her energy work until my abdomen settles back down onto the bed. I don't know how she did it, but the tension is gone.  The same thing happens after she removes the needles and begins massaging my head to drain the toxins out of my lymph system. ""Why are you moving your head like that?"" she asks, as it rocks side to side.  Uh, I thought she was doing that.  It's another blockage. (In my brain?)  When the procedure is complete, I don't see dramatic differences. Sure, my eyes look a bit brighter, the skin under my chin is slightly more taut and my normally pale face is shining with an unnaturally healthy glow.  What I do notice, however, is how my body feels - blissfully relaxed and slightly wobbly, as if I have just emerged from a warm bubble bath. I think I'm beginning to understand the ancient Chinese secret. If you feel this good, who cares about wrinkles? Alexandra Gill is a feature writer for The Globe and Mail. The demand for complementary health care is booming. In 2000, Canadians spent approximately $500-million on natural health-care products.  Within a six-month period in 1999, approximately 30 per cent of British Columbians and Albertans, and 25 per cent of people from Ontario, had been to an alternative-care practitioner at least once. Although those numbers do not specify which type of alternative treatments they sought, TCM represents one of the most widely used forms of complementary medicine, along with massage and naturopathy.  Who's most likely to consult complementary and alternative health practitioners? Female patients (21 per cent of Canadian women have had a consultation, compared with 17 per cent of men), and people aged 25 to 54. (About 23 per cent of Canadians in that age group say they've turned to alternative care, compared with 16 per cent of those 55 and over, and 14 per cent in the 12 to 24 age group.)

""But it is an issue that is being addressed for the protection and the safety of the general Canadian.""   Royal assent for the controversial Bill 50 launched the process of creating a self-regulating professional body that will be known as the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario - similar to those that govern doctors, nurses, chiropractors and physiotherapists.  The college will be responsible for setting standards, licensing practitioners, establishing disciplinary procedures for malpractice or misconduct and setting up a complaints committee that will look at grievances.  ""Previously, there was no restriction on who could practise traditional Chinese medicine in Ontario, or who could call themselves a practitioner. So it comes down to public protection,"" said A. G. Klei, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.  Dr. Cheung, who has been practising the technique of inserting and manipulating needles into meridian points on the body for nearly 40 years, says many of the services being offered in Ontario in recent years have become very lax, too often resulting in serious injuries.  ""There was a patient being treated by a practitioner with a reused disposable needle. They don't throw it away, they keep it and reuse it. Then there are cases of lung punctures with the needle. [In another case, a] needle wasn't inserted properly in the leg and it caused swelling because it was inserted in an artery.""  Because the practice was unregulated, there was no way for injured parties to file a complaint, and no one has successfully sued for malpractice.  Although the government expects it will be two to three years until the college is established, Dr. Cheung is glad to see that the process, for which he has been lobbying for more than 20 years, is finally under way. It not only protects Ontarians who are increasingly turning to alternative forms of therapy, but it also ""is an official recognition of Chinese medicine, the whole regimen,"" he says.  Ontario joins British Columbia as the only provinces to regulate TCM and acupuncture. Two other provinces, Alberta and Quebec, regulate only acupuncture. About 48 U.S. states, along with England and Thailand, also have some type of regulation of Chinese medicine similar to those put into effect by Bill 50.  The college will be responsible for establishing different classes of Chinese medicine practitioners to avoid having practitioners wage a turf war with chiropractors and physiotherapists for exclusive rights to practise acupuncture. The classes would differentiate between medical doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, with advanced education, and practitioners with a general education in traditional medicine.  Kin Wong, who has been running his family's South China Herbs Market in Toronto for the past 16 years, says the legislation will severely harm the way in which he can help patients because he cannot claim to be a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, diagnose illnesses, or prescribe remedies.  Mr. Wong, 37, learned the trade from his father, who was taught by his grandfather. Canadians are aware that many of the herbs used in Chinese medicine aren't scientifically tested, he says - people choose to go into shops such as his.  ""I'm more than willing to put a sign up in my window that says these medicines have not been tested and that people are venturing into uncharted territory,"" Mr. Wong says.  He is worried that the red tape that will come with the college will scare many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners out of their profession and will mark the end of the industry ""in a few years.  Paul Jang, a Toronto acupuncturist who is a strong supporter of the legislation, agrees that the new rules will take a toll on the industry. Of the roughly 3,000 practitioners across Ontario, Mr. Jang estimates only 800 will be qualified enough to become licensed under new regulations because many of those currently practising do it part-time and don't have more than a year of specialized training.  ""The people who don't like Bill 50 are the ones who are scared they won't be able to practise any more. The ones with the right qualifications have nothing to worry about,"" he said through a translator in his clinic."

216,1217.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Trust me, this won't hurt a bit","We ask the experts to settle common questions we've all wondered about. QUESTION  When should I consider using acupuncture? How do the needles work? How painful are the needles? What are the risks of acupuncture?  ANSWER  According to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is an important therapy for every person's overall well-being. They use it for the prevention and treatment of a long list of medical conditions including migraines, insomnia, stress, depression, fertility issues, pain, neurological conditions and shingles, as well as drug, alcohol and smoking addictions.  Aside from these conditions, they recommend it for everyone (regardless of health status) twice a year between fall and winter, and in spring and summer as well-being maintenance. They suggest that these seasonal adjustments are important because the body can have a difficult time adapting to a new season, making it more vulnerable to diseases and infections. That's why, they say, you see a spike in flu cases in late winter and early spring.   The basis of acupuncture is simple. In Chinese medicine, it's believed that in a healthy body, energy flows through channels smoothly. If that energy flow is disrupted, the person may become ill or suffer from pain. Each person's body has more than 300 acu-points where energy flow can be disrupted. Acupuncturists determine the disruptions by taking the patient's pulse, reading his or her tongue and feeling his or her muscle tone. Needles are placed at the disrupted acu-points to resume the energy flow, which is thought to improve the patient's well-being.  Some research studies have suggested that stimulating acu-points triggers the brain to produce many different compounds - such as endorphins - which improve an individual's disease condition or reduce pain.  Because no two individuals are identical and their conditions are different, the required frequency of acupuncture treatments ranges between patients. Through an initial assessment of the patient, the practitioner will determine the best treatment plan.  The degree of acupuncture's effectiveness also differs between patients. For some, the treatment reduces symptoms, and for others it is believed to cure the condition.  Acupuncture clinical trials are challenging because it's difficult to come up with a proper placebo; however the results are intriguing. Researchers often compare ""real acupuncture"" with a control group called a placebo or ""sham"" in which non-traditional sites are used, or the needles retract into the handles when pressed against the body so they don't penetrate the skin.  A double-blind, controlled study in Australia revealed that inserting needle to a single traditional point (the forearm, close to the wrist) reduced post-surgery nausea, while the sham therapy did not have the same effect.  However, in a recent German study involving headache patients, the participants getting the ""real acupuncture"" reported feeling only slightly better than the group who received the placebo. It seems that pressing a faux needle against the skin may be enough to produce the desired effect. Or, there is simply a strong ""placebo effect"" to acupuncture treatment itself.  Nonetheless, acupuncture is considered a safe and recognized practice that is increasingly being used alongside Western medicine. A properly trained acupuncturist will place a needle gently so that it is painless, or the pain is no worse than a mosquito bite.  Like most treatments, however, there are risks if it is administered incorrectly. There are rare instances when a practitioner inserts a needle improperly, puncturing a patient's organ or causing serious internal bleeding. The other risk is contracting a bacterial or viral infection through the needles. This can be avoided by using disposable needles and using the right technique (which most reputable practitioners do). To be safe, ask your acupuncturist at your first assessment about his or her training and experience to confirm the quality of care.  If you're considering acupuncture, a good first step is to speak to your family physician for more information about how acupuncture and Western treatment can work together to improve your health.

217,1218.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Can acupuncture help you get pregnant?; Studies looking at IVF patients using the treatment to conceive have had mixed results and raised some questions," Acupuncture may help some women conceive through in vitro fertilization (IVF), a new analysis of past research concludes. But the true benefit in the clinical setting, if any, remains unclear.  The technique has been used for millennia in traditional Chinese medicine, for a whole range of ills.  Ten years ago, a study in Germany was the first clinical trial to report that acupuncture seemed to improve pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF. But since then research has turned up mixed results.   ""I counsel women that the literature is not convincing yet that [acupuncture] helps you get pregnant,"" said Frederick Licciardi, who heads the New York University Fertility Center's mind/body program.  At the centre, women can opt for acupuncture sessions, yoga and other ""mind/body"" services, but that's aimed at easing stress and promoting general ""wellness"" - not at boosting IVF success, said Dr. Licciardi.  Clinical trials on the issue so far have been small, and often of questionable quality.  So for the new study, reported in the journal Fertility and Sterility, Chinese researchers conducted what's called a meta-analysis - where researchers combine the results of past studies to try to get an idea of the overall picture.  Cui Hong Zheng and colleagues at Tongji Medical College pooled the results of 24 small clinical trials testing the effects of acupuncture in women undergoing IVF.  The trials varied widely: Many tested needle acupuncture, some electro-acupuncture and some included laser acupuncture.  The studies also differed in what they used as a ""control.""  In many trials, IVF patients either received acupuncture or nothing. In others, researchers used a form of ""placebo"" acupuncture such as applying blunt needles to the skin surface. Some researchers used real needles, but stimulated points not related to fertility, according to traditional medicine.  Dr. Zheng's team found that overall, women who had acupuncture had a slightly higher pregnancy rate than women who did not have the therapy - but no higher birth rate.  The results looked a little different, though, when the researchers excluded five studies that used blunt needles as a control.  When those trials were dropped, women in the remaining studies who received acupuncture fared a little better: 41 per cent became pregnant, versus 37 per cent of those who did not have acupuncture.  Three of those trials also looked at birth rates. Of women who received acupuncture, 35 per cent had a baby, compared with 25 per cent of women in the control groups.  According to Dr. Zheng's team, the findings suggest that the blunt-needle acupuncture used in some trials is not a truly ""inactive"" placebo, and may actually have effects similar to the real thing.  And that, the researchers say, may explain why those studies failed to find benefits from real acupuncture.  But Dr. Licciardi - who stressed that he is ""not anti-acupuncture"" - was unconvinced.  One of the big problems with the analysis, according to Dr. Licciardi, is that it combined studies that were all looking at very different things: different types of acupuncture, different controls, and different timing of the acupuncture sessions.  He was also skeptical of the researchers' choice to drop certain trials, which then essentially gave them ""the results they wanted.""  In the bigger context of acupuncture research, finding a good control has long been a problem.  The gold standard for proving that any medical treatment works is to randomly assign patients to receive the treatment or a placebo, with neither the patients nor the researchers knowing who is getting the real thing.  If a trial is testing a drug, it is easy enough to give the control group sugar pills.  But with acupuncture, it has been hard to find a widely accepted placebo version - one that has no, or at least minimal, physiological effects but is convincing enough that patients think they're getting acupuncture.  The bottom line, according to Dr. Licciardi, is that no one yet knows if acupuncture can really make a difference in IVF success. But if a woman wants to try it simply to feel better or de-stress, there would be little harm.  As for why acupuncture would help a woman get pregnant with IVF, no one is sure of that either.  There's some evidence that needle stimulation may improve blood flow to the uterus. And researchers are looking at whether acupuncture might make the uterine wall more receptive to the embryo. "

So some are turning to traditional Chinese treatments such as acupuncture. And as, LESLIE GRANT TIMMINS reports, finding themselves on fertile ground"," 'Our GP couldn't tell us why we weren't getting pregnant,"" says Shannon Kush, a 31-year-old student of sign language and deaf studies in Vancouver.  Ms. Kush and her husband, Garrett, a chiropractor, have a four-year-old daughter, but after two years of trying to conceive another child and failing, they were considered to have ""unexplained infertility.""  A friend recommended traditional Chinese medicine and Ms. Kush reluctantly decided to try it. After three months of acupuncture and herb treatments, she was pregnant.  Today, one in six couples in North America is infertile and 15 to 20 per cent of them will never know why. Add to this the fact that women are delaying childbearing to pursue careers and that Western medical treatments offer women aged 35 to 39 only a 30-per-cent chance of conceiving, and it's not surprising that there's a boom in other kinds of medicine. Some fertility clinics in Canada are now recommending acupuncture to their patients.  Chi (pronounced chee), or energy, is the basis of Chinese medicine. An imbalance of chi at any point in the body's system can cause symptoms or disease. To correct an imbalance, herbs and acupuncture are prescribed. Supporters say traditional Chinese medicine is non-toxic and relatively affordable compared with Western reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), which costs on average of $10,000 and more.  ""We couldn't afford in vitro,"" Ms. Kush says candidly. She had already tried a fertility drug for six months and undergone surgeries for endometriosis, a condition in which the lining of the uterus attaches outside the organ, causing scarring.  Although skeptical of the theory of Chinese medicine and terrified of needles, she decided to try the treatment. The herbal mixtures ""tasted like dirt,"" she says, but after only a month of taking them and having acupuncture treatments, she saw changes. ""My nails weren't splitting any more and my hair stopped falling out. After a couple of months, my PMS lightened. My menstrual cramps, which usually had me curled in a fetal position on the bed at least a day a month, went away.""  Now pregnant, Ms. Kush is due to give birth in July.  She was treated by Lorne Brown, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. ""In Western medicine, PMS is considered to be normal and isn't associated with infertility,"" Dr. Brown says, ""but in Chinese medicine it indicates a subtle imbalance that needs to be corrected.""  Hair loss, which suggests prolonged stress, is also associated with infertility. ""If the stress is reduced and the chi is able to flow freely,"" he explains, ""all parts of the body will be nourished, including the hair and nails.""  In treating infertility, Dr. Brown follows the principle that you must ""nourish the soil before planting the seed""- improving the overall health of the reproductive organs in order to optimize conception. ""Ideally, I treat women for about three cycles with acupuncture and Chinese herbal mixtures to regulate their menstrual periods and balance their hormones,"" he says. ""The quality of the egg and the health of the baby are influenced by the woman's health during this time."" Dr. Brown refers to recent medical studies showing that acupuncture can increase blood flow to the ovaries and uterus. ""This improves the quality of the eggs and thickens the uterine lining, making it more receptive to implantation.""  He treats patients who are trying to conceive naturally as well as those who are preparing for IVF and other reproductive technologies.  It was a combination of IVF and acupuncture that helped Brenda Swartlikoff, 38. She and her husband, Jason, had been trying to have a child for more than five years. After her first IVF embryo transfer, Ms. Swartlikoff suffered a miscarriage. After two more unsuccessful transfers, she tried insemination, but no luck.  ""Somewhere in there we began adoption procedures,"" she says. ""I also decided to see a Chinese-medicine doctor.""  After several months of acupuncture treatments alone, Ms. Swartlikoff tried another IVF and became pregnant. She soon noticed some changes. ""Within a month of starting the acupuncture, my cycle went from 33-32-31 days right to 28 days and it remained like that through my entire in vitro process. And I felt so relaxed after each treatment, like I'd been to a spa.""  Just over a week ago, she gave birth to a healthy girl.  Although Western science has just begun to investigate the 2,500-year-old traditions of Chinese medicine, studies support Brenda Swartlikoff's positive experience.  ""Acupuncture is one of the hottest things in the infertility field right now,"" says Alice Domar, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the Domar Center for Complementary Healthcare at Boston IVF, a large fertility clinic. ""From a scientific point of view, the research on acupuncture and infertility is tantalizing,"" Dr. Domar says. ""A 2002 study by [Dr. Wolfgang] Paulus got worldwide attention and showed a lovely increase in pregnancy rate using acupuncture during in vitro fertilization cycles.""  Published in the prestigious medical journal Fertility and Sterility, this study compared two groups of 40 women aged 21 to 43. One group received acupuncture to relax the uterus, the other did not. Twice as many of the women who received acupuncture became pregnant.  But Dr. Domar remains cautious. ""Other studies have not been as supportive of the hypothesis and suggest it may be a placebo effect. We need more data.""  Stephen Hudson, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and medical director of the Victoria Fertility Clinic on Vancouver Island, has no such reservations. ""I recommend all of my patients who are undergoing treatments such as IVF consider acupuncture. I think it relaxes them. Anything that positively affects your mental and physical health is going to help you improve the odds of getting and staying pregnant."" Leslie Grant Timmins is a freelance writer based in Vancouver. A year ago, Tom Nadeau of Montreal was diagnosed with male infertility factor. A salesman, he attributes his very low sperm count and motility to the heat and constriction of long work hours in his car every summer. Male infertility factor accounts for one-third of infertility in couples. Female infertility accounts for another third, but most assisted reproduction technology is aimed at women.  Both Mr. Nadeau (not his real name) and his wife, Joan, opted to be treated by Aina Zhang, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine - Ms. Nadeau, 38, to optimize her general health and Mr. Nadeau, 33, for infertility.  Following Dr. Zhang's advice, Mr. Nadeau reduced his work hours, changed his diet, drank teas made of specially prescribed Chinese herbs and underwent once-a-week acupuncture treatments. ""I was skeptical at first,"" he says, ""but now I like the Chinese philosophy of balancing everything. It takes a while, but the results are there."" After a year of seeing Dr. Zhang, Mr. Nadeau's semen analysis shows normal levels. A 2005 study published in the medical journal Fertility and Sterility backs up his experience. It showed significant increases in the number and motility of sperm in men who had acupuncture treatments. Three weeks ago, the Nadeaus used intrauterine insemination to try to conceive. The procedure, in which sperm is injected directly into the uterus, requires healthy sperm. For Tom Nadeau, it was no problem.  - Leslie Grant Timmins"
219,1220.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Research spurred by the lucrative herbal market," In Asia, the race is on to tap into the multibillion-dollar Western market for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).  In Singapore, a predominantly ethnic Chinese island, plans are afoot to pour millions of dollars into university programs and research to scientifically prove, and improve, the efficacy of acupuncture, traditional health foods, medicinal wines and herbal treatments.   Taiwan joined the race last year by unveiling a $100-million (U.S.) five-year-plan to be a ""TCM Technology Island"" by 2006.  And Hong Kong is aiming to establish itself as a forerunner in the scientific study of traditional Chinese medicine by 2009. Last year, the city saw the launch of an Institute of Chinese Medicine, funded by a consortium of organizations that includes the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which runs part of the city's huge gambling industry. Like other new bodies in the region, the institute is subjecting age-old remedies to the scientific rigour of clinical trials.  Ping-Chung Leung, an orthopedic surgeon and chairman of the Hong Kong institute's management committee, says the trials are following procedures sanctioned by the National Institutes of Health in the United States and the World Health Organization.  Leung, who is heading up the institute's research on a traditional medicine that is showing great promise in treating diabetic foot ulcers, says the issue is not traditional versus Western medicine.  ""We have to be open-minded and willing to consider alternatives that are effective and safe in treating patients,"" says Leung, whose father was a herbalist. ""We're not about to give up the practice of Western medicine, just trying to add to the arsenal of treatments.""  Other priority projects for the institute include a treatment for hepatitis B, a study to see if a preparation of three common Chinese herbs reduces asthmatic children's dependence on steroids, and the testing of a herbal supplement that may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in patients with cancer.  Leung and other experts in the field believe that scientific evidence to support the efficacy of traditional remedies and a U.S.-style patent system to protect medicines resulting from those findings will bring in much-needed income for the region.  The trials are also aimed at testing the safety of TCM treatments. Western doctors have expressed concern about the toxicity levels found in some herbal remedies and about their interaction with prescription drugs. Serious questions have also been raised after tests in Western countries have found that some imported Asian herbal medicines are poorly made and adulterated with dangerous substances.  While Leung and others are working to bring traditional remedies into the modern scientific world, some practitioners are wary of academic attention, fearing that the Western medical establishment wants to eliminate competition from remedies it considers unproven.  In the end, a new generation of researchers in Asia and the West would probably agree with David Eisenberg of Harvard University, who addressed 600 Chinese health-care professionals attending a conference on alternative medicine last summer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  ""Real gold does not fear even the hottest fire,"" said Eisenberg, quoting a Chinese proverb."
220,1221.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Alternative treatments gaining ground  Medical establishment taking notice as more Canadians turn to naturopathy, homeopathy","   East may not have met west this year, but alternative treatments made remarkable advances toward joining Canada's medical mainstream. Frustrated by the failures of medicine to cope with AIDS, cancer and such mystery illnesses as chronic fatigue, Canadians are looking to therapies including naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine in increasing numbers.  At least 3.3 million Canadians a year sought treatments outside the medical establishment last year, spending at least $1-billion that was not reimbursed by provincial health plans in the process, according to Statistics Canada.  The amount spent on vitamins and food supplements is rising by 20 per cent a year and exporters of Chinese herbal medicine report they expect sales to double by the year 2000. Critics have always contended that treatments outside the medical realm are not backed by careful scientific research and that their practitioners are generally not regulated. Now all that may be about to change. Among changes this year: Across Canada, naturopaths, acupuncturists and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine began making bids to be regulated as medical professionals; Vancouver Hospital established an alternative-medicine clinic to conduct research on the effectiveness of Chinese, Ayurvedic and native treatments; Vancouver Hospital also opened a Healing Touch Centre, to do therapies aimed at balancing energy fields in the body. About 1,000 professionals have now trained in a similar technique, Therapeutic Touch, which has been recognized as a treatment by the College of Nurses of Ontario; And researchers at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto announced plans to conduct clinical trials of four Chinese herbal remedies to treat psychiatric conditions. To meet the growing demand, several alternative medical schools this year increased their enrolments and moved to larger facilities. ""There is so much demand from students who want to become naturopaths we plan to double our enrolment over the next four years,"" said Audrey Adams-White, president of the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. In September, the college opened classrooms and labs for 200 students on two floors of an office tower at Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue in downtown Toronto. ""We're really achieving liftoff as a profession,"" commented David Sleight, the school's incoming president, at a $500-a-plate black tie dinner that raised $1.2-million for the new facility. In 20 years, the number of naturopaths in Ontario has risen from four to 250 and Mr. Sleight said that number is expected to double again within five years. Many naturopaths, homeopaths, and specialists in Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture have begun to describe their treatment as complementary to mainstream medical care. They attempt boost restorative systems to let the body do its own healing. They say patients are coming to them because medicine can't cure their ills or they believe drugs and surgery are too invasive. ""Essentially, complementary medicine is an attempt by patients to get some control over their bodies,"" said Dr. David Ostrow, who headed an advisory board of doctors at Vancouver Hospital that approved establishment of the Tzu Chi Institute within the hospital. ""Naturopaths have been organized and have had a coherent voice,"" Ms. Adams-White said. The practice, which was established in 1902, accredits only one school in Toronto and three in the United States. To get an ND, a degree in naturopathic medicine, requires taking a four-year graduate program that includes 4,000 hours of medical training. An Ontario committee has heard applications that support including naturopaths under the Drugless Practitioner's Act and a ruling is expected soon from the Health Ministry. In April, British Columbia, where at least 20 per cent of people use alternative therapists, recognized acupuncture as a therapy that may be performed by someone without a medical degree. Ontario is also considering approval for acupuncture. Among the groups moving most quickly toward approval are naturopaths, who take training similar to an MD but aren't permitted to do surgery. They rely on a broad range of treatments, from changes in diet to Chinese herbal medicines and homeopathic remedies and massage with the aim of improving the body's ability to heal itself. Practitioners say they take more time with patients than medical doctors ever do and try to get at the underlying causes for their symptoms. Students are required to have three years of premedical studies before entering the four-year program at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. However, because licencing is a provincial matter, each province is in a different stage. In addition to Ontario, naturopaths are applying for recognition in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta. But in Quebec it's a different story. ""They are not regulated and in Quebec there are many people who identify themselves as naturopaths but don't meet our standards,"" Ms. Adams-White said. Quebec's College of Physicians and Surgeons has recently taken action against some naturopaths.  ""I find Canada still a bit backwards about alternative medicine,"" said Jan deVries, an advocate for alternative treatments. ""I have talked to many Canadian officials over the years and I find it very difficult to get the message across. ""In Europe there is more recognition because of pressure from the public. In Holland, a very skeptical minister of health said 'It's not me but the people who want it.' It helped a research team at the University of Utrecht who have been working to prove homeopathic medicine works.""  In Germany and Switzerland, naturopaths and homeopaths have regulatory boards and independent groups that act as advisory committees. There has been movement toward recognition in France, Britain and Scandinavia as well, he said.  ""But Canada has been very slow,"" Mr. deVries said. ""Although I do find a very steady growth of public interest. Even in small towns, alternative-health shows that once were the realm of the curious few now draw thousands and thousands of people."""

Lavender, as many aromatherapy aficionados know, helps to promote relaxation. And feeling relaxed is one of the objectives at Akuklinik, his integrated health centre that specializes in treating infertility and eliminating allergies and sensitivities. Nestled at the end of a walkway off verdant Hazelton Avenue, the clinic is a wellness hideaway where acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine offer an alternative to prescription drugs and turnstile consultations.  Since it opened just over a year ago, Akuklinik (klinik is the Swedish spelling) has attracted a largely female patient base consisting of those trying to improve their chances of conceiving naturally and others who wish to complement artificial reproductive techniques with acupuncture. But Dr. Rock, who is a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, is also gaining a reputation among Torontonians who have discovered that he is the only acknowledged practitioner in Canada to offer Advanced Allergy Therapeutics, an emerging non-invasive treatment that reduces negative reactions to otherwise benign substances.  ""If someone can't breathe when they walk into a room with a cat, that's not really a normal situation,"" he says.  ""It's an immune-system error,"" he explains of the rashes that people can develop to substances such as latex or silver. Through a gradual process of manual pressure and exposure to small amounts of the allergen, the body will no longer respond adversely. He used it successfully to treat his own hay fever. Dr. Rock has attracted some holistically inclined celebs, who pass through town eager for natural remedies more common on the West Coast (doctor-patient confidentiality prevents names from being printed). He is the first to admit that concocting herbal tinctures is a far cry from his former days of burning the midnight oil as an investment banker in London. ""It was a drastic step, but I thought drastic steps were necessary,"" says the Tokyo-born Brit, whose trim physique and boyish features belie his 44 years.  In the early nineties, he ""suddenly became quite ill,"" and a doctor of Chinese medicine was the only person who ""turned me around, very quickly."" Once recovered, he adopted a non-traditional health-care regimen. Determined to shake up his lifestyle, he became a 32-year-old student at Vancouver's International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.  Years of clinical work in British Columbia, China, Britain and Germany eventually led to the decision to establish a practice in Toronto, a city he describes as ""similar to London but without all the bad things.""  Dr. Rock counts more than a dozen babies born in Akuklinik's brief lifespan and more are on the way. ""It's pretty rewarding,"" he says. ""People go through an incredibly tough time emotionally when they desperately want to have children.""  At the bare minimum, he is able to improve symptoms associated with infertility for women and men (from irregular periods to lower sperm counts). And the fact that local IVF clinics have referred patients to Dr. Rock for additional support is proof positive that his work is not dismissed by conventional doctors.  Akuklinik is still undiscovered enough that people won't encounter waiting lists, but this is likely to change as AAT gains traction as an effective allergy therapy. Dr. Rock says there's nothing stopping him from setting up additional locations. Meanwhile, he notes that he has never felt healthier. ""I have to be,"" he says. ""[I] can't be doing this kind of work if I'm not in fairly good shape medically and physically.""  He makes time for yoga, boxing, tennis and working out at the nearby Yorkville Club. Fatherhood has eluded Dr. Rock thus far, though it is not out of the question. One gets the sense that he has spent the past few years devoted to his career.

222,1223.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,New hopes for an old practice; The ancient form of Chinese exercise and meditation; known as qigong is gaining wider acceptance as a tool; to promote relaxation and control chronic pain," By day, Douglas Ying runs an acupuncture clinic in Vancouver where he's had resounding success healing people with chronic pain. By night, around the stroke of 12, he sets time aside to practise ancient Chinese exercises that help him maintain his own well-being.  In a very quiet room, with a little light, he relaxes both body and mind by focusing on his breathing. After about 10 minutes, he begins to feel the chi - the invisible vital energy that, according to traditional Chinese medicine, flows through organs and along internal pathways, or meridians, in the body.  It starts off just below the navel, in the lower tan tien, an area that is believed to be the central storage place for chi in the body.  ""Chi is warm and it pushes in the spine,"" Mr. Ying explains. ""It goes up along the spine to the head, then down inside through the chest and abdomen."" One circle takes just a few seconds to complete. But in that brief time, the chi is playing a crucial role in preventing the onset of illness, he says.   The centuries-old system of using breathing, meditation and gentle movements to release internal energy is called qigong (also referred to as chi kung).  But it is more than just exercises that people can do on their own to maintain good health. Qigong is also used as a form of medical treatment. Skilled practitioners, such as Mr. Ying, say they can use their own highly balanced chi to correct the internal energy flow of people suffering from illness or injury.  ""Qigong for me is really interesting because you can treat some serious diseases, and it costs almost nothing,"" says the 50-year-old who used to be the vice-secretary of a qigong association in China representing more than 30,000 practitioners.  Like acupuncture, another means of releasing blocked energy, qigong is one part of traditional Chinese medicine, a system of health care that has a growing number of followers in Canada and is winning increasing mainstream legitimacy. British Columbia recently decided to recognize the practice of Chinese medicine as a licenced health profession. And other provinces might eventually move in the same direction.  Mr. Ying gets many referrals, from B.C.'s Workers Compensation Board, of people with workplace injuries that Western medicine hasn't been able to heal.  Stewart North, a driver of logging trucks from Vancouver Island, suffered a herniated disc in October, 1999. ""It was the most excruciating pain I've ever experienced,"" he remembers. Surgeons told him the only option was to remove the disc, an operation that would have left the 53-year-old unable to return to work.  As a last resort, he turned to Mr.Ying and after 11 visits, Mr. North is back on the job, working 12 hours a day, ""with not a tinge of pain.""  His treatments were made up of acupuncture and qigong sessions during which Mr. Ying would gather his own chi in his palms and then direct it to Mr. North's body. The effect is like that of a strong magnet exerting its force over a weaker one, qigong practitioners explain.  For skeptics, it might sound like nothing more than pseudo-science. Because chi is invisible, it's difficult to prove exactly what it does in the body, according to Randy Wong, registrar at the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia, the province's regulatory body.  ""Chi can be seen as something very mysterious,"" he says, ""and some people don't believe it exists.""  But some Western health-care providers are finding scientific explanations for the beneficial effects of qigong. Indeed, even if the practice just helps people relax, it would lead to positive effects on the body. After all, prolonged stress leaves a person vulnerable to a host of ailments including headaches, sleeplessness and heart disease.  In the book Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide, California osteopathic doctor Roger Jahnke notes that various studies have suggested that qigong initiates the ""relaxation response."" This decreases heart rate and blood pressure. It also dilates blood vessels, allowing for greater oxygen circulation in the body.  There are thousands of ways to practise qigong, explains Warren Fisher, who has run a Chinese medicine clinic in Nelson, B.C., for the past 10 years. It can be done sitting, standing still, lying down or through a series of movements.  It's appropriate, Mr. Fisher adds, that the Chinese character for chi is made up of three lines that look like layers of clouds. This shows how qigong can vary, just as clouds are constantly shifting.  Although some people spend years perfecting their technique, qigong doesn't have to be complicated, according to Henry Lu, founder of the International College of Traditional Medicine in Vancouver.  One way of releasing chi is simply by lying down on your back, with your head slightly higher than your shoulders, and breathing in a controlled rhythm: inhale, stop, inhale, exhale.  ""The essential thing is to bring your mind to a focus and to concentrate on one thing, such as the breathing, so that eventually you think about nothing,"" Mr. Lu explains.  The myriad preoccupations of modern life can greatly imbalance a person's chi and lead to poor health, he says. ""In our daily lives, we have too many things in our minds and this can introduce many harmful side effects in the body. Our emotions are responsible in many ways for our illnesses.""  With this kind of across-the-board appeal, it's not surprising that qigong is becoming increasingly popular in Canada, with classes being offered at community centres and at private tai chi schools.  Many Canadians are already familiar with tai chi, the exercise system of flowing postures that people often do outdoors in groups. Tai chi, which has its roots in martial arts, is also said to release the flow of chi in the body.  But qigong is easier to learn because it has fewer movements and more repetition, says Sheila Furness, a teacher at Toronto's Tai Chi and Meditation Centre.  In a lowly lit room that looks like a dance studio, she puts eight qigong students through an hour-long workout. There's not a lot of talking during the class. ""It's a matter of internal focus,"" Ms. Furness says. ""We do a lot of visualization.""  A key principle of traditional Chinese medicine is balance between the body and the environment and much of the imagery used in qigong is inspired by nature.  ""Imagine you're a tree with roots running deep into the earth,"" Ms. Furness tells the students during a meditation posture done standing up. ""Get rid of your body's stagnant energy through your feet and to the roots. Then, imagine you're dragging pure energy back into your body.""  Students rub their hands vigorously and bring them to various parts of their bodies, an act that is said to impart chi to the organs. Then they work through a series of gentle, moving postures, called the Five Element Palm exercises, designed to release chi in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys.  It may sound easy. ""But there's actually a lot more to it than it looks,"" says Ken Poole, 63, a fire-prevention officer at the University of Toronto. ""It looks very relaxed and very flowing. But it takes a while to get the movements down.""  Even though it can take years before people experience the physical sensation of chi flowing through their bodies, qigong advocates say health benefits are immediate simply because of the body's relaxation response triggered by this meditative activity.  Since the mind-body connection is an essential pillar of Chinese medicine, the state of a person's spirituality cannot be completely separated from the quest for good physical health. And some people use qigong as a means of spiritual transformation and enlightenment.  In China, this has led as far as political unrest. Falun gong, a spiritual movement based on qigong, has millions of followers so devoted that Chinese authorities perceive it as a huge threat and have outlawed it. There have been brutal crackdowns, imprisonment of falun gong members and protests, ending in violence.  Aside from falun gong, there have been other controversies in China associated with qigong. Two years ago, a man who promised cures through his powers of manipulating chi was sent to jail by a Chinese court after being accused of giving unauthorized medical treatment and causing the death of 146 patients.  The possibility of qigong being abused by charlatans is one reason why Canadian advocates of Chinese medicine say it's essential to have the practice regulated, especially since it appears to be growing at a steady pace here.  Yun Yee, a Toronto radiologist, started going to a qigong class last month. But she first witnessed its healing powers 20 years ago on her father. At the time, he had a slew of medical problems such as ulcers and chronic lower back pain.  ""Then he started to do qigong,"" Dr. Yee remembers. ""His cheeks became all rosy and he stopped complaining about his pain.""  Since then, she's been interested in qigong but never found enough time to learn it. Now, at 34, she says, ""I'm at a time in my life when I want to focus on preventive medicine.""  Dr. Yee admits some doctors she works with are skeptical about qigong.  ""It's not something that's taught in medical school here. It's a completely different medium from Western medicine,"" she says. ""My feeling is they're complementary."" Most qigong practices can be performed anywhere at anytime, in any type of clothing. According to traditional Chinese medicine, these exercises use the body's own energy, or ""chi"", to heal and maintain vital organs and boost metabolism.   Once warmed, place the hands over a specific organ of the body. Move the hands in a circular motion, continuing to create heat, while breathing deeply and relaxing. At the same time, visualize the chi moving out from the hands and penetrating into the organ.   Move your palms around to your lower back. Chi is said to help the kidneys produce energy, eliminated waste products more efficiently and activate healing throughout the body.   Apply your hands to the lower edges of the rib cage, where these organs are located. Chi energy is believed to help the spleen produce white blood cells, aid the pancreas with digestion and assist the liver in removing toxins from the body.   Place your hand on your breastbone, sending chi energy to the heart to help it circulate the blood. Practitioners believe the heart is the resting place of the emotional and spiritual self, so chi helps to nurture these elements as well."

It was only when she was in her late 30s, and with three children, that she decided to pursue her passion and see how far it would take her.The Sydney-based Yallamas enrolled as a mature-aged student for the bachelor of health science in traditional Chinese medicine at the University of Technology, Sydney. The four-year, full-time course covered everything from acupuncture to herbal medicine, with instruction in techniques such as tui na massage, cupping and gua sha (a skin-scraping technique). ""It was terrific but very intense,"" Yallamas says. ""Almost from day one we would practise sticking needles into one another. I was never one of those people who were afraid of needles, so that wasn't a problem, but some of the students were a bit funny about it."" As a student sheobserved qualified practitioners and helped with the running of the Chinese medicine clinic based at the university.She says the main focus of her degree was acupuncture; an ancient practice dating to at least 100BC. The theory behind it is that needles are inserted into the body to cause changes in the pattern of the patient's energy system (qi). Acupuncture has been used to treat a range of issues from pain and fertility to migraines, nausea, and osteoarthritis.In Yallamas' final year of study, she began practical training with Health Space in Rozelle. She also applied to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to register as a clinical acupuncturist.The training and registration led to a full-time position with Health Space and she has been working there since February.""It's been great,"" she says. ""I look forward to coming to work because I spend my day helping people to manage their health. I've even had children visit me for treatment for conditions such as asthma and insomnia."" Yallamas is employed as a subcontractor for Health Space, which provides a room and marketing support. She has no immediate plans to set up her own practice, although she would be qualified to do so.""I enjoy being part of a multi-modality group because I don't feel so isolated ... I'm surrounded by like-minded people."" Yallamas says she is required to keep up to date with the latest studies and information. She regularly attends conferences and training courses to earn professional development points.She says an acupuncturist can earn from $60 to $100 an hour.Associate Professor Chris Zaslawski is the program director at UTS' traditional Chinese medicine course. He has been practising acupuncture and herbal medicine for 30 years and is a researcher in the area.""There's no question that the interest in Chinese medicine has grown over the past five years,"" Zaslawski says. ""There are currently six accredited educational programs in Australia including our course at UTS."" He attributes the growing demand for the subject partially to the national regulation of Chinese medicine three years ago. ""Before that time, anybody could call themselves a practitioner,"" he says.""The regulation has probably contributed to the increasing student demand for Chinese medicine programs and a higher public profile of the profession.""He is also seeing a high proportion of international students and second-generation Chinese students enrolling in the course. The acceptance and increasing use of Chinese medicine in Australia may also be another factor.Only a handful of Chinese medical practitioners are employed in the public and private hospital systems, but Zaslawski believes that will change.""As the evidence for the efficacy of Chinese medicine mounts, we may see our graduates employed in the system,"" he says."

Sunny P. Wang is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner at the Pure Natural Chinese Herbs and Acupuncture Centre and teaches at The Sydney Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Corine Patching: How will registration of TCM practitioners, which is proposed for Victoria in 2000, affect the profession?Sunny Wang: Statutory registration of practitioners in Victoria will be a good example to all States because it ensures that TCM qualifications will be recognised by the Government and patients will receive a high-quality, safe service.CP: In what direction do you see the TCM profession in Australia heading?SW: Australians are open-minded and knowledgeable, so if they find their Western doctor is not doing enough to heal them, they will come to us. I see TCM playing a more important role in the health care industry. Some Western doctors are recommending Chinese medicine nowadays and some qualified doctors (although not a lot) are prescribing herbs. In the past 10 years, degrees and diplomas in TCM have been offered by universities and private colleges in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.CP: What kind of problems might I encounter in obtaining raw herbs from overseas? Is Australia interested in producing these herbs?SW: Herbs can usually be obtained from overseas without any problems, but they must meet Australian import conditions. For some products you will need to apply for a permit to import quarantine material, ora permit to import wildlife products. At this stage it is too costly to produce the small amounts of herbs needed here.CP: What sort of homework do you need to do to establish a practice?SW: First, prepare yourself. You will need to have a lot of practical experience built on theoretical knowledge and you will need a first aid certificate. To establish your clinic, you will need to talk to the health officer in your local council area for the details of skin penetration requirements and procedures for registering your business. When it comes to competition, TCM is indemand - there are still not enough practitioners in Australia, especially in distant areas - and publicinterest is definitely increasing.CP: What effect will the GST have on your practice?SW: Services such as acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine services are GST-exempt if TCM businesses are registered within three years. GST will apply to Chinese herbal products, which will change from the current sales tax rate of 22 per cent. All up, it's not really a big change. I don't think my practice will suffer when the GST arrives."
225,1226.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chinese puzzle; Health,"Western medicine can't always explain how it works, but treatments from the East are gaining acceptance.Faced with acute pain, most people head for the nearest hospital. For many chronic conditions, however, more than 5 per cent of Australians now use traditional Chinese medicine, according to Professor Charlie Xue, head of the division of Chinese Medicine at the RMIT University.Western medicine is some way from wholeheartedly embracing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), but there have been moves to incorporate aspects of it. ""When I came to Australia from China 12 years ago, the medical profession didn't want to know about Chinese medicine, but now it's more open-minded,"" Xue says.In Xue's case, this open-mindedness has seen his treatments incorporated into an emergency medicine setting. ""My team now provides acupuncture to treat patients in pain at the emergency department at Melbourne's Northern Hospital - if we'd suggested this 10 years ago, people would have laughed at us."" The World Health Organisation has acknowledged the role such medicine plays in health treatments, and in 2002 launched a strategy to gather more evidence on its safety and efficacy. That same year, Australia's first Chinese Medicine Clinical Research Centre opened in Liverpool Hospital to run clinical trials of herbal medicine and acupuncture for gynaecological problems.The trials included research into the effect of Chinese herbs on endometriosis. Sydney policewoman Gina*, 32, took part in the trials and, after a decade of debilitating period pain, no longer juggles her shifts to ensure her time off coincides with her periods. ""The first period I had after taking the herbs was much less painful, and by the second month, there was no pain at all,"" she says. ""It's been life-altering.""Meanwhile, with two unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilisation, only one functioning fallopian tube and her 41st birthday looming, Joanne Day wasn't optimistic about conceiving - especially when a doctor diagnosed problems with her new partner's sperm. ""The specialist said the only way we'd conceive was with IVF, but I didn't want to go through that again,"" says Day, who instead consulted Jann Mehmet, a TCM practitioner in Rozelle. After a few months of regular acupuncture and a healthier diet, she conceived at 41 and had a baby at 42.""The word is out that acupuncture can treat muscular-skeletal problems, irregular periods, coughs and colds, infertility and many other conditions,"" says North Shore practitioner Melissa Scott.""At first people came as a last resort. Now we find that people who have success with Chinese medicine often come with subsequent problems, rather than go to a GP first. What draws many people is that they're wary of the side effects of some Western medication.""Drugs are often Band-Aids that treat symptoms but not the underlying cause - with eczema, for instance, you can be given cortisone to reduce inflammation but it doesn't address the cause. TCM on the other hand can help by strengthening the immune system and digestive function.""Few Western-trained doctors refer patients to a TCM practitioner, though one doctor now refers children with eczema to Scott for pediatric massage - an alternative to acupuncture for children who are afraid of needles.The barriers to more doctors referring patients for TCM include lack of registration - only Victoria has a registration system for its practitioners - and lack of evidence for its benefits.Still, Xue says, it is the subject of increasing study and there's some evidence that acupuncture helps treat headaches, period pain, back pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Studies suggest it may improve IVF's success, though it's unclear why.""It may increase blood flow to the uterus,"" says Dr Caroline Smith, who has conducted a study of acupuncture and IVF through the University of Adelaide. ""It needs more research, but we know acupuncture does no harm and may increase women's chances of success.""As for Chinese herbal medicine, its acceptance lags behind acupuncture, which now attracts a Medicare rebate provided it's done by a medical doctor trained in acupuncture. But Australian research has found that Chinese herbs can slow liver damage caused by hepatitis C, and animal studies at Sydney's Garvan Institute of Medical Research suggest a Chinese herb, berberine, shows promise for diabetes by helping to reduce blood sugar levels.At the University of Technology, Sydney, trials of a Chinese herbal formula in rats has found it reduces the risky symptoms of metabolic syndrome - pot belly, high blood pressure, high blood fats and insulin resistance.Evidence to support TCM is building, yet its mystique persists because it's hard to find Western medical explanations for how it works.Unlike Western medicine, which often reduces the cause of illness to a specific organ or system in the body, TCM attributes disease to an imbalance affecting many different parts of the body. It holds that good health depends on a strong flow of an energy source called ""chi"" coursing through meridians or pathways in the body - we get sick when pathways become blocked, preventing the flow of chi.This may have its own logic - but X-rays can't detect a blocked meridian and there's no test to measure chi.But Western medicine could explain why some research suggests acupuncture may improve polycystic ovarian syndrome, the hormonal disorder affecting 5 to 10 per cent of Australian women.With this disorder, ""the levels of male hormones are increased, disrupting menstruation and fertility,"" says Dr Danforn Lim of the faculty of medicine at the University of NSW, who is studying the use of acupuncture to treat the syndrome. ""Studies have found acupuncture helps menstruation and fertility return to normal.""This may be due to acupuncture's effect on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Research suggests acupuncture raises levels of beta-endorphins, the body's natural pain-killers produced by the hypothalamus, which controls the hormone-regulating pituitary gland, Lim explains.As for the effects of herbal medicine on period pain, about 55 trials from Japan, Taiwan and China say it's effective, says researcher Dr Xiaoshu Zhu, of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney.According to Chinese medicine, herbs work by clearing blocked meridians and strengthening the reproductive system, she says, but a Western explanation might be that they have an effect on hormones, relax uterine muscles or reduce prostaglandins, chemicals thought to cause period pain.There are parallels in Chinese and Western medicine, Zhu says, but ""you can't always make sense of Chinese medicine in Western medicine terms"".As with others trained in both practices, she believes learning both gives practitioners more skills to draw on. Or as Xue says, ""Neither is perfect - but if we can get the best of both worlds, we get the best for patients.""*Name has been changedCan acupuncture provide relief from hepatitis C symptoms?Working in a drug rehabilitation unit, Sydney acupuncturist Christine Berle worked with people who had hepatitis C - the chronic viral disease infecting the livers of 242,000 people in Australia, and causing 16,000 new infections annually. When her patients went for routine tests after a few weeks of acupuncture, their liver function had dramatically improved. Now Berle, a postgraduate student at UTS, is conducting a trial to see whether 12 weeks of acupuncture has any effect on liver function in people with hepatitis C. The drug treatment available to clear the virus does not work for everyone. Anyone interested in joining the trial at the UTS Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, Broadway, or at Berle's practice in Guildford, should phone 9632 8989.Find a reputable practitionerThere is no independent regulator in NSW, although practitioners are pressing for a formal registration system like Victoria's Chinese Medicine Registration Board. Dr Chris Zaslawski, director of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine at UTS, suggests word of mouth or checking with a reputable professional association such as the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association. TCM practitioners are trained to be alert for signs that could mean serious illness, he says, but without access to the same diagnostic tools as Western physicians there is a risk of a delayed diagnosis.

226,1227.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Natural therapies; Special report,"A brief glossary of termsACUPUNCTUREAccording to ancient Chinese tradition, energy (or chi) flows through the body via meridians which interconnect across the surface of the body and are linked to major organs. Acupuncture involves the painless insertion of fine needles through the skin at points on the meridians to correct body imbalances. In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture points can also be stimulated by the heat from a burning stick of special herbs (moxibustion). Acupuncture is widely used for pain relief and has proved a useful tool in the management of chronic conditions such as arthritis, asthma and stomach disorders.AROMATHERAPY Harnessing the restorative properties of blends of different essential oils, the aromatherapist employs a combination of specialised massage techniques to bring about a positive effect on the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of the individual. Aromatherapy may be used to treat a variety of conditions including stress and skin disorders.AYURVEDIC MEDICINEThought to be the oldest of all the natural healing systems and practised in India for more than 5,000 years, Ayurvedic medicine takes a highly personalised approach to the treatment of disease. Ayurveda stresses the importance of prevention and encourages the individual to be aware of his or her own constitution and learn how to maintain harmony through a combination of thought, diet, lifestyle and herbs.BIOFEEDBACKAn unconventional technique in which subjects learn to improve their health and performance by being aware of signals from their own bodies. Using special devices, subjects can be trained to alter heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension and other physical functions that are not normally controlled voluntarily and thereby develop new, healthier habits.CHIROPRACTICChiropractors aim to alleviate pain and improve general health through adjustments of the spine. The fundamental theory behind the healing system is that most ailments result from a slight misalignment of the vertebrae. Because the nervous system is the body's control centre, chiropractors believe that adjusting the spine can have an impact on other parts of the body.HERBAL MEDICINEPlants and plant extracts have been used in all cultures throughout history and Western or botanical herbal medicine is an important part of naturopathy practice today. Based on Hippocratic principles, herbal medicine sets out to treat the individual, not the disease, evaluating the whole lifestyle before the prescription of extracts and tinctures.HOMEOPATHYA form of natural medicine developed in the late 18th century by a German physician, Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy is based on the Law of Similars which states that ""like cures like"". Hahnemann held that highly diluted homeopathic substances (usually herbal or mineral) which in a healthy person will produce symptoms of disease, will cure those same symptoms in a sick person. Homeopathic medicine is highly regarded in the UK where it enjoys the patronage of the Royal Family.IRIDOLOGYOne of the diagnostic tools used by many naturopaths, iridology involves careful examination of the condition of the iris of each eye, to gain an understanding of the constitution and the individual's state of health and nutritional requirements. The practitioner also looks for tiny abnormalities or flecks which could indicate disease in certain parts of the body.KINESIOLOGYAn unorthodox method of monitoring an individual's wellbeing by studying body movement through manual muscle testing. Employed by some holistic practitioners, kinesiology is thought to identify the factors blocking the natural healing process. Therapy involves attention to reflex and acupressure points, the use of specific body movements and nutritional supplements.NATUROPATHIC MEDICINEThe naturopath treats the whole person by using the body's inherent ability to heal itself. To support the natural healing process, naturopaths are trained to use a variety of complementary therapies which can be employed according to individual patients' needs. They include nutrition, herbalism, homeopathic remedies and remedial treatments such as massage and relaxation therapies.OSTEOPATHYA system of therapy that employs deep tissue massage as well as manipulation of the spine, joints and surrounding soft tissues, with particular focus on improving back problems, joint dysfunction and muscular disorders.REFLEXOLOGYA remedial therapy believed to work with both the lymphatic system and the circulatory system, reflexology or zone therapy involves the stimulation of pressure points on the feet to assess and treat many conditions.TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINEAn ancient health care method that combines acupuncture, medicinal herbs, food therapy, different types of massage (shiatsu, acupressure) plus therapeutic exercise and relaxation techniques such as tai chi.YOGAThe physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation practices of yoga have been shown to be helpful in alleviating stress, lowering blood pressure and regulating heart rate. Some devotees even claim that regular practice will help retard the ageing process.-"

But a handful of studies has found acupuncture can help and recent Swedish research determined it improves ovulation in women with the syndrome, boosting their chances of pregnancy.If acupuncture proves effective, it has the potential to help a lot of women. In Australia, 12 to 18 per cent of women of reproductive age are thought to have PCOS. Its cause is a mystery but likely to involve genes and lifestyle. A family history of type 2 diabetes increases the risk.So how can tiny needles inserted under the skin have an impact on a woman's ovaries?""We don't know for sure how it works, but one theory is the needles act on the sympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, affects the hormones that control ovulation,"" says Jane Lyttleton, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner specialising in infertility, who uses acupuncture in her Sydney clinic.""It's still early days, but we have evidence that acupuncture and, in particular, electro acupuncture, has good success - electro acupuncture involves passing a low-frequency electric pulse through fine wires attached to acupuncture needles.""Underlying the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, which include excess hair and acne as well as disrupted ovulation, is a rise in levels of male hormones produced by the ovaries.This is caused by insulin resistance, common in women with the syndrome, which often increases testosterone production. Although acupuncture shows promise in improving ovulation, there's little research on its effects on other symptoms, although, anecdotally, acne often improves, Lyttleton says.Although some branches of complementary medicine arouse scepticism among conventional medical practitioners, attitudes towards acupuncture in female infertility are more open, says Dr Caroline Smith, associate professor in complementary medicine at the University of Western Sydney.She is working on a study of more than 1000 women undergoing IVF, some with polycystic ovary syndrome, to see if acupuncture increases their chances of a live birth.""There's already some evidence that when acupuncture is used around the time of embryo transfer it improves the chances of pregnancy,"" she says.""It may be that acupuncture increases the blood supply to the uterus which may improve the odds of the embryo implanting itself successfully.""Twelve IVF centres are taking part, which shows the level of interest in establishing an evidence base, she says.Acupuncture may also help cool hot flushes at menopause, Melbourne GP Dr Caroline Ee says.She is involved in a study of the effects of acupuncture on hot flushes at a number of research centres, including the University of Melbourne, Jean Hailes for Women's Health, RMIT University, Southern Cross University and Monash University.""Most studies so far have been small and inconclusive, but two have shown that acupuncture can make a difference,"" Dr Ee says.""I've seen a lot of women with hot flushes in my practice and when I go through the treatment options with them, they're very resistant to using drugs so I've tried acupuncture and it has helped some of them.""Hot flushes happen when the body's thermostat goes haywire. Antidepressants often help, she says because they raise levels of the brain's ""feel-good"" hormone, serotonin, which helps regulate body temperature.""Acupuncture also raises serotonin levels so it may work in a similar way,""Dr Ee says.Paula Goodyer blogs atsmh.com.au/chewonthis.See jeanhailes.org.au."
228,1229.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Pins & needles; Wellbeing,"Acupuncture, that ancient Chinese therapy, is finding new popularity among the Western ailing and even gaining acceptance from the medical fraternity.For Melbourne rock'n'roll drummer Bobby Johnson, a regular acupuncture session ensures he maintains the rhythm of life. The fortnightly treatments have cured his indigestion, bronchitis, stress and lethargy. ""Everything,"" says the 59-year-old, ""feels better after acupuncture.""Johnson is one of about 3 million Australians a year who have their meridians artfully tweaked via a needle or 10. The popularity of acupuncture - which is used to treat a plethora of ills ranging from hiccups to depression - has spiked in the past decade, with the number of Australian practitioners almost doubling. The Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association (AACMA) estimates that 1700 to 1800 primary or ""non-medical"" acupuncturists operate throughout Australia. Add to that the roughly 2500 doctors who incorporate acupuncture into their medical practices and it seems we have become a nation of complementary medicine converts.""It's grown phenomenally,"" says AACMA chief executive officer Judy James. ""People used to try acupuncture when all else failed but now we're finding people are coming to acupuncture as their first port of call. It doesn't surprise me that it's become as accepted as it has because it works."" How acupuncture works is becoming less of a mystery as Western medicine and science open up to the validity of a treatment that's been administered in China for more than 2000 years. This ancient practice operates on the principle of ""qi"" (pronounced ""chee""), the ""life energy"" within all of us. Devotees believe qi flows through meridians (a network of invisible channels throughout our bodies) and maintains the harmony, balance and order of our systems. Practitioners say that when qi is blocked by an injury or a deficiency in the flow of energy in the meridians, we succumb to illness and disease.Acupuncture is not for the faint-hearted - sterile fine needles are inserted into one of 300 specific points on the body (there are forbidden areas on the chest, face and genitals) to clear energy blockages and restore the flow of qi. Needles remain in place for 15 to 30 minutes and are occasionally twisted or tapped by the acupuncturist to stimulate energy flow. The insertion of the needles is not painful to most people but the area around the needle can sometimes produce a mild ache or pulling sensation.Our acupuncture points can also be stimulated by laser and electro-acupuncture and the more ancient methods of cupping and moxibustion. Cupping is the technique of applying suction over selected points of the body - a vacuum is created by warming the air inside a glass or bamboo cup and overturning it onto the body to disperse areas of congestion. Moxibustion, on the other hand, is the burning of a cigar-like roll of the herb Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) held close to the skin near the acupuncture points.Sound like hocus-pocus? Perhaps. But for a staggering number of Australians, it's working. ""In the 1970s, it was described as voodoo,"" says Professor Alan Bensoussan, director of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney. ""But as we learn more about how it works, there's a recognition of the validity of the practice. Through controlled clinical studies, we now have enough evidence that it creates a whole lot of neurophysiological changes. We know that neuro hormones in the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream [such as adrenaline] are affected.""High-profile devotees of acupuncture have sharpened our interest even further. Swimmer Grant Hackett added cupping to his pre-Athens preparations and Madonna and Prince Charles have both been stuck. US golfer Fred Couples attributes his champion swing to acupuncture. Cher swears by acupuncture facelifts. Hailed as a hot alternative to Botox, needles are inserted directly into wrinkles and facial muscles to stimulate blood flow and collagen regeneration.But beyond elite athletes and celebrities, it's everyday people with everyday complaints who are seeking the magic needles. Strategically placed needles can dilute and even eliminate the pain associated with migraine, neck and backache, arthritis and sports injuries. Respiratory and digestive conditions can respond to acupuncture and issues relating to gynaecology and fertility are among the fastest-growing areas in acupuncture consultation.Bensoussan and his team at UWS started teaching acupuncture as part of a four-year degree course in traditional Chinese medicine in 1999. It is one of a number of Australian universities (including University of Technology Sydney, RMIT University and Victoria University of Technology) offering accredited degrees that include acupuncture.Since Medicare scheduled acupuncture as a rebate in 1991, demand for qualified practitioners has mushroomed. Dr Vicki Kotsirilos, a Melbourne GP, began offering acupuncture in 1991 and today treats more than one-third of the patients at her Clayton practice with both traditional and laser acupuncture. ""Medical acupuncture integrates well for doctors,"" Kotsirilos says. ""Instead of using pharmaceutical medicine, I can offer acupuncture as an alternative.""Kotsirilos ""pins"" about 20 of her 60 patients a week to treat everything from nausea and PMS to cigarette addiction. After an initial one-hour consultation, each session lasts for about 15 minutes to half an hour. (The cost of an acupuncture session with a GP is about $50, of which $26.25 is refunded on Medicare. Most private health insurers also cover acupuncture.)As a non-medical acupuncture practitioner, Hoc Ku Huynh has been applying his traditional techniques for 28 years. ""When I first started practising acupuncture in Sydney in 1976, nobody knew what it was,"" he says. Today, Huynh has tens of thousands of patients on file. In his small practice in Sydney's Chinatown he sees an average of 100 patients a week and business is booming. ""In the past 10 years, there has been a 300 to 400 per cent growth in popularity. I'm getting a lot of referrals from GPs and other medical practitioners now.""After spending every winter from the age of 14 swallowing antibiotics to treat chronic bronchitis, Bobby Johnson was looking for a natural alternative. He discovered acupuncture in 1998. Not only did it treat and prevent his bronchial condition but it has also helped with his drumming. ""I was having trouble with my forearms,"" he recalls. ""They were stiff and tight. I was a pretty hard player. The acupuncture loosened up that tension and it was easier to play.""Johnson says he hasn't taken antibiotics for six winters and that his fortnightly acupuncture treatments have put a spring in his step. ""All I know is that after I've had it, I feel all-over good,"" he says. ""I'm fit and energetic and I don't have to take tablets.""Johnson's reasons for opting for acupuncture are common, says Bensoussan. ""It might seem an unnatural process but people now see it as a way to stimulate the body's own responses to manage disease and dysfunction. It's drug-free. People view it as a natural form of intervention.""Side effects are minimal and rare. Accredited practitioners are required to use disposable, single-use needles to minimise the incidence of infection. Still, about 0.4 per cent of patients may experience nausea, dizziness, fainting, headaches or localised infection after treatment. Kotsirilos says she treads lightly until she gets to know the patient's threshold. ""It doesn't suit everybody,"" she says. ""Some people are very sensitive to it.""On the flip side, Kotsirilos adds, ""I've been able to treat so many conditions. I've been able to offer cancer patients relief with pain and nausea. It's very effective in palliative care. I use laser acupuncture on children with things like asthma and eczema and they respond really well. We need more research.""For Hoc Ku Huynh, research relies not so much on scientific studies but rather on his own intuition. ""Acupuncture is an art. It also requires some instinct. In traditional acupuncture, we learn with our fingers. It's the way we've been doing it for 2000 years."""
229,1230.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Hitting the spots; treatment,"Forget your fear acupuncture doesn't hurt and has been a cornerstone of Chinese medicine for thousands of years, VICTORIA YOUNG writes.NEEDLES can strike fear into the bravest soul, so images of 8cm steel pins protruding from our body even in the name of good health may be a bit unsettling.But this ancient Chinese treatment has won many converts in the West so, with increasing numbers swearing allegiance to its healing powers, this reporter braved needle phobia to investigate.On a busy road in Sydney's Surry Hills lies the Acu-Herb Chinese Medicine Clinic. It is run by David Lau and John Chang, acupuncturists and Chinese medicine practitioners who both have Masters of Health Science degrees in Traditional Chinese Medicine from the University of Technology, Sydney. Chang was my acupuncturist and before any needles were in sight he assessed my eyes, the colour of my tongue, asked how I was feeling overall and checked the pulse on my wrist with three fingers rather than two.There are 28 pulse states in Chinese medicine, with names such as slippery, rapid and wiry, and acupuncturists are looking for the strength and quality of the pulse to indicate any health problems.I was declared healthy, apart from my cough.Lying on a table with two needles in each hand and two in each wrist when you are trying to fix a cough may seem odd, but acupuncture points appear not to correspond to their intended targets. A point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothache, while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.The number of needles and where they go depends on the location of the complaint and its severity there isn't a limit or set number of needles you can have.The needles are made of very thin steel. They are about 8cm long, disposable, and don't hurt at all. Inserted into the top layer of skin, they feel like tiny pinpricks until 15 minutes later when the skin around them becomes very sore.This is common and a sign that the acupuncture is working. Every 10 minutes or so Chang checked on the needles, which stay in the skin for a total of 30 to 40 minutes. The treatment didn't cure my cough but I walked away feeling a lot more relaxed.So what exactly was going on with those needles?Acupuncture is the study of restoring energy flow to the body. One way to understand it is to look at the body as an electrical circuit but with energy rather than electricity flowing through it. The quality of this energy is affected by yin and yang the complementary forces of nature which are an integral concept of Chinese medicine. An imbalance in either obstructs the flow of energy and this may lead to illness. In Mandarin, the word for this energy is qi (pronounced chee).The idea with acupuncture is to restore the balance of yin and yang and keep the body's energy flow moving effectively along pathways there are 14 of these which travel through the body and pass through major organs such as the liver, kidneys and heart.Lined up along these pathways are acupuncture points more than 500 of them. Inserting very fine needles into the skin at these points stimulates the body's energy flow.""When you have an acupuncture treatment a whole battery of things happen it activates the nervous system, the immune system and the hormonal system,"" said Dr Im Quah-Smith, a medical acupuncturist and GP who marries Western medicine with acupuncture in her Sydney clinic.""In acupuncture you're trying to restore the body to an optimal level of function,"" Quah-Smith said. ""It's a bit like a car whether you've got enough petrol in the tank and enough coolant in the radiator. Bearing in mind some people have a genetic tendency to certain things going wrong, so you improve on that as best you can. Or you can have very healthy people who burn the candle at both ends.""Until about 10 years ago modern medicine was always looking at disease and disease treatment. From medical school onwards, modern medicine doesn't really teach how the body stays healthy what you need to keep it going well. Doctors should really be taught a lot more about dietetics and the body's healing ability.""In contrast to Western medicine, acupuncture takes a holistic approach to health this means that it treats the whole person rather than just the symptoms of an illness or disease.""Chinese medicine looks at the role which emotions, social interactions and the environment have on the body and how they can cause disease or illness,"" Chris Zaslawski, director of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine at UTS, said.""The Chinese have a saying you don't dig a well when the drought has started or you don't start making spears when the war has been declared. It implies that you have to take a proactive approach [to maintaining your health].""Acupuncture began in China 5,000 years ago, but exactly who discovered it and how widely it was used isn't known. There are two schools of thought as to how it developed.""The theory used to be that people discovered the points by chance,"" Alan Bensoussan, head of the Chinese Medicine Unit at the University of Western Sydney, said.""If someone stubbed their toe, their headache would be gone or if someone was bruised in the shoulder, their knee pain would be gone. The theory was that through trial and error over centuries people identified a range of trigger points and these points were connected by channels. But that theory is pretty much debunked now.""In a predominantly agricultural society, ""the Chinese learned to manipulate water flow extremely well"", Bensoussan said. ""They learned about dams and circulation of water and the theory now is that they felt there was a similar flow of blood and energy in the body that could be moved and channelled and controlled as well.""Acupuncture is thought to have arrived in Europe in the 17th century via Jesuit priests and reached Australia during the gold rushes of the 19th century. By 1857 there were at least 20 practising acupuncturists on the goldfields.But it wasn't until then US president Richard Nixon visited China in 1971 that Western awareness of acupuncture really took hold.It gained official recognition in 1979 when the World Health Organisation issued a list of 49 health conditions appropriate for acupuncture treatment (see panel).The largest acupuncture association in Australia, the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association (AACMA), has 1,200 members, of which 350 are based in NSW. The current entry requirement is a four-year qualification, such as a bachelor degree in Acupuncture.Victoria will soon be the only State which requires acupuncturists to be registered. From January next year, The Chinese Medicine Registration Act will also set education levels for acupuncturists.A spokesman for NSW Health said the State would wait for the Federal Government to issue requirements for acupuncturists. So far, a discussion paper has been sent to health ministers but no date has been set for turning it into legislation.""At the moment it's buyer beware, unless the acupuncturist is a member of a reputable association,"" AACMA executive officer Judy James said.Lau said registration would give acupuncturists ""more credibility and more confidence from the public. I think it's important and it's 10 to 20 years overdue already"".To find an acupuncturist in your area, call the AACMA on 1800 025 334 (website: www.acupuncture.org.au) or call the Australian Medical Acupuncture College on 1800 803 853.Going with the flow of energyAcupuncture is used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:Stress, high blood pressure, insomnia, headaches, migraines, poor circulation, muscle cramps, cold hands and feet. For women, acupuncture can help increase fertility and treat morning sickness, leg and ankle swelling and back pain during pregnancy.In 1997, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that acupuncture helped treat nausea after chemotherapy and anaesthesia and during pregnancy and was useful for treating post-operative dental pain.The NIH panel also said acupuncture might work with traditional Western medicine in treating addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, general muscle pain, lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma. The panel said it found no evidence for or against the existence of qi (energy).In 1979, the UN's World Health Organisation listed 49 conditions which it considered appropriate for acupuncture treatment. These included arthritis, back pain, the common cold, bronchitis, tonsillitis, toothache, ulcers and constipation."

There is a soothing smell in the air and a relaxing feel about the space.A recent graduate of the University of Western Sydney's Bachelor of Applied Science (TCM) course, 23-year-old Licht is keen to promote the benefits of the alternative medicine.""The technology available in western medicine offers an advanced diagnosis procedure which is essential, especially in emergency situations,"" she says. ""But what TCM has to offer is alternative treatment options that don't necessarily have the extreme side effects that can occur in allopathic medicine.""A general practitioner and member of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), Dr Roberta Chow , however, has reservations about the practice of TCM by graduates who are not also trained in western medicine: ""The best option is someone who can practise both.""She says her primary concern is inadequate training in differential diagnosis: ""You cannot pick up cancer from tongue and pulse diagnosis.""A lot is known is about the pharmacological action of many of the herbs [used in TCM], but the gold standard evidence for the efficacy in specific conditions is lacking,"" she says.""Even if the patient is happy to try the herbs in the absence of the evidence, they may still run the risk of potentially serious interaction with pharmaceutical drugs they might be taking, such as warfarin that prevents blood clots.""Alan Bensoussan , associate professor in TCM at the University of Western Sydney, believes there is enough cumulative experience with TCM to allow well-trained practitioners to use it effectively and safely.""Students study the pharmacology of common drugs in order to help them understand potential herb and drug interaction,"" he says.Bensoussan says the four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Applied Science(TCM) offered at UWS is a demanding, intensive program, with three main divisions of study.""The first is medical sciences, the second is traditional medical theory learning the herbs and acupuncture points,"" he says.""And the third major component is the integrated clinical practice.""What makes our course unique is the strong clinical training focus. Students are expected to complete more than 1000 hours,"" he says.Bensoussan says professional issues are included, including ethical and legal issues, research methods and communication skills.So what is TCM? Bensoussan explains: ""The major branch [of TCM] is Chinese herbal medicine, which includes the use of plant, animal and mineral substances. """"The second major branch is acupuncture,"" he says. ""While the third branch covers the areas of dietary and lifestyle advice, movement activity such as Tai Chi and Qi Gong , and chinese massage and manipulation.""Chow says that because the raw herbs used in the practice of TCM are unregulated, patients can be at risk from pesticide or heavy-metal contamination.Aristolochia , a family of herbs found to cause kidney failure, has been banned by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.A spokeswoman from the TGA says: ""The TGA regulates the ready-made formulas, but regulation for the raw herbs, which practitioners use to make compounds they sell direct to their clients is more difficult. This responsibility rests with the state authorities.""Bensoussan says there is unanimous support within the TCM profession for practitioner regulation in NSW.""Currently anyone, including doctors, can claim they are an acupuncturist or herbalist without having even studied the field for one hour,"" he says.""There is an increasing body of evidence to support practices in acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, so the issue of practitioner regulation begins and ends with public safety.""Chow isn't convinced : ""Because there are so many uncertainties in the practice of herbal medicine, undue credibility shouldn't be given to the practitioners by registering them.""She says the AMA supports regulation of TCM practitioners, but not registration as is the case in Victoria.""The current medico-legal environment will certainly impact on the TCM practitioner. And the fact it has been used for thousands of years will be no protection,"" says Chow.""The bottom line is a lot more money needs to be put into research so patients can get the best of eastern and western medicine in a safe environment."""

He has recently established a clinic in Bondi with a colleague. Helen Gordon is one of Sydney's most respected practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. She became an acupuncturist 10 years ago. Emin Liao: What makes a good acupuncturist?Helen Gordon: A distinction needs to be made between a fully trained acupuncturist, who has completed a specialist four-year qualification, and a practitioner who has merely done a short course. The full training gives a complete view of treatment and the way disease affects the body. A good acupuncturist needs to understand the interconnectedness between body, mind and spirit. Acupuncturists need confidence, empathy and to practise what they preach. Patience and humility are crucial to realising that Chinese medicine's 2,000 years of accumulated wisdom cannot be learnt in four years of study. It takes a lifetime.EL: What benefits are there to being an acupuncturist?HG: I spent 18 years working in the NSW hospital system and I believe acupuncture provides a wider scope of treatment principles than Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine theory has a complete view of how we function in our environment and is able to identify disease at a much earlier stage, often well before it manifests at an organic level. This enables earlier treatment. A successful course of treatment can change a person's whole life.EL: What are the prospects for acupuncture practitioners?HG: Since I started working as an acupuncturist, the public perception has changed dramatically. Initially, many of my patients presented with chronic conditions that had not responded to other treatments. Now, acupuncture is the primary health care for most of my patients. Doctors have been much slower to accept us but I'm sure that, faced with increasing numbers of people helped by acupuncture, this will eventually change. I hope we will soon have the same relevance here as we do in China.EL: What conditions do you think acupuncture treats most effectively?HG: Traditional Chinese medicine has a complete view and method of medicine and can therefore be used to understand and treat all forms of illness. Dramatic results can be seen with gynaecology, pediatrics, gastrointestinal problems and colds and flu. I treat people with all kinds of problems. Some have very unusual symptoms and some have very rare diseases. Not a week goes past that I am not completely blown away by someone's positive response to treatment.EL: Will there ever be integration of acupuncture into our health system, similar to that of some Asian countries?HG: I hope so. I would like to be able to work with Western doctors to give patients choice. This approach in Chinese hospitals offers patients the best of both worlds and, as a result, I have seen dramatic results achieved with cancer, obstetrics, post-surgery and stroke patients."
232,1233.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Getting better by degrees; Health for Life,"Moves to produce highly trained alternative health practitioners are coming from within the industry itself, writes MARGOT DATE.WITH Australians spending about $1 billion a year on alternative health treatments, remedies and clinic visits, there is a huge demand for practitioners in every field, from acupuncture to osteopathy, and naturopathy to herbal medicine.Many of these subjects come under the umbrella of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and it is in this area that great strides have been made in the education of experts. Australians have had access to well-trained practitioners for 20 to 30 years, with private colleges being responsible for their training. Some of these are being incorporated into universities, while others continue to teach and practise alongside conventional Western heath-care facilities and practitioners.But, due to a lack of occupational regulation in many of the fields, the public can be duped. The unscrupulous operator can simply hang a shingle and begin seeing clients.With the growth of degree courses and the establishment of research centres, such as the Herbal Medicines Research and Education Centre at the University of Sydney, standards are being tightened. Universities are graduating students in a number of alternative health fields and occupational regulation is under discussion by practitioners and governments.In a study of the practice of TCM, Towards a Safer Choice, for the Victorian Department of Human Services and the NSW and Queensland departments of health, Alan Bensoussan and Stephen Myers found 13 major programs offered by universities and private colleges for TCM qualifications. These offered more than 800 contact hours. There were another 10 programs with contact hours ranging from a few to 390.While variation existed, they wrote, four years for acupuncture or Chinese herbal medicine, and five years for a combination was considered an appropriate duration by the industry.The study estimated that about 1,200 students will graduate from TCM qualifying programs and start practising by 2000, which will almost double the numbers of primary TCM practitioners in the workforce. Students are a mix of school- leavers, medical professionals and others looking for a career change.Bensoussan, head of the research unit for complementary medicine at UWS Macarthur, says a five-year osteopathy degree course will begin next year and a TCM course will open in 1999.The courses will be a three-year Bachelor of Applied Science followed by a two-year Master of Applied Science, with three years on a science degree and two years for either strand. ""There is a big demand for a high-quality program in TCM,"" Bensoussan says.""There is a great demand from the public for practitioners because usage is really high. There are questions over qualifications of practitioners because they can vary from nothing to five or six years.""Universities may be seen by some of the private colleges as slow to jump on the bandwagon but Bensoussan says it is more likely that there has been some holding back by tertiary institutions because TCM and other alternative fields use theory and language that is different from orthodox Western medicine, which can be the major centrepiece of educational institutions.The report's co-author, Myers, is head of the School of Natural and Complementary Medicine at Southern Cross University at Lismore. The school offers a four-year degree course in naturopathy, a system of healing and preventing disease using lifestyle, exercise, diet, rest and relaxation.""About 60 per cent of the students would be classified as mature age and 40 per cent from the Higher School Certificate,"" Myers says. Only 10 to 15 per cent would already have a degree.""It is a course for self-starters,"" he says. ""There is not the support industry as there is for medicine or nursing. Students need to be able to establish their own clinical practice or opportunities.""The momentum for moving alternative medicine courses from private colleges into universities has in many instances come from within the professions but also from consumers' demand for better-qualified practitioners.Professions, Myers says, are going through their own developmental stages and demanding higher standards of themselves.One college which has made the move to a university campus is the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine at UTS which operated from 1969 to 1994 as the Acupuncture Colleges (Australia).Its degree courses include the Bachelor of Health Science in Acupuncture and the Bachelor of Health Science in Chinese Herbal Medicine. Both courses run for 31/2 years.The head of the college, Associate Professor Carole Rogers, says half the students were mature age and many have a background in healing, such as orthodox medicine, nursing or veterinary sciences. Others are from overseas and many have some qualifications already.""A lot of people who trained overseas are quite anxious to have recognition from Australian tertiary institutions,"" Rogers says.Many graduates of both courses go into private practice, often in a group with other practitioners such as physiotherapists, naturopaths or orthodox medical practitioners.One of the largest private colleges, with more than 1,500 students, is the Australasian College of Natural Therapies, in Surry Hills. The principal, Freida Bielik, who is an osteopath, chiropractor and naturopath, says many of her students come to the college to help themselves or family members.""People are coming in because they are generally dissatisfied with something,"" Bielik says. When they find the answer for themselves, often they want to go on and help others. Her experience is common. Bielik's interest in natural therapies was stirred when her asthmatic son was successfully treated by an osteopath.She is driven by a desire to help others and an ambition to take natural medicine out of the realms of ""hippie healing"", and founded the college in 1981.The college teaches a range of subjects, including herbal medicine, nutrition, sports injury therapies, homoeopathy, reflexology and remedial massage. It has government accreditation for its courses."
233,1234.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Pins & needles; WELL-BEING,"Acupuncture, the traditional Chinese approach to healing, is now making its mark in Australia with a shift towards mainstream therapy.MATTHEW'S first jab for the day is a painful one. He is supine on the bed, staring at the ceiling, bare except for a pair of shorts. There is a crackling noise behind him as Chinese stainless-steel needles are prised out of their foil packets.Carole Rogers, Associate Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney, College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), hovers beside him in a white coat, feeling the pulse at his wrist. She studies it intensely, cocking her head gently to one side, her eyes appearing to focus on something outside the room.""Hmmm . . . the liver's still upset . . . and the stomach hasn't settled yet,"" she says. ""I think we'll just try to get some energy into the stomach today."" She snaps on surgical gloves and swabs the skin below his knee with antiseptic lotion. She takes a needle, about two centimetres long, taps it firmly into the surface of his skin through the guide tube, and slides it in. A dim flicker of pain crosses his face. ""Very nice of you not to scream for the paper,"" Professor Rogers says.She's joking, of course. They can banter like this because he's one of her students at the UTS's rigorous four-year Bachelor of Health Science in TCM. This is his third treatment for lethargy and nausea since he returned from Bali several weeks ago.""It's not the needle that hurts,"" he explains. ""It's all the bad qi [energy] in my legs - it feels like when you've got really bad pins and needles in your leg when you've sat on it the wrong way.""She leaves him to relax for 20 minutes, looking rather like a human pincushion, and slides the door quietly behind her. ""Who's next?"" she asks the woman at reception, and races down the corridor to the next patient.It's not just Rogers' Broadway clinic that is full: hundreds of students apply for one of the 60 places in the UTS course each year and this pattern is repeated at several other Australian universities that offer degrees in acupuncture.After 5,000 years of mainstream practice in China, more and more Westerners are finally beginning to appreciate the health benefits of this ancient Chinese therapy, Rogers says.She says there is now a more open-minded attitude to the possibility that the Chinese medical model - which posits the existence of invisible ""energy meridians"" in the body - may have something to offer.But it has certainly taken its time to be embraced. ""Acupuncture has been treated with great suspicion for many years in Australia as 'Chinese folklore',"" she says.Stories about black magic and dirty needles provided terrific fodder at doctors' dinner parties for many years, Rogers says. But now, articles about acupuncture have crept into conservative journals that once dismissed the discipline as quackery.So what is it? Acupuncture therapy teaches that the human body is similar to a highly complex electromagnetic circuit. To maintain good health, the body's energy or qi must circulate freely along pathways called meridians. If the circuit is broken, the result is illness.By stimulating points on these meridians with needles, the quality, quantity and flow of the qi can be normalised.Acupuncture practitioners say the treatment can cure a wide range of disorders, from neurological problems, circulatory complaints, respiratory conditions, digestive ailments, skin and visual problems, muscular and skeletal complaints to psychological problems and sporting injuries.Although it is still impossible to evaluate scientifically the beneficial effects, acupuncture has been standard treatment in China for hundreds of years for critical illnesses. A Sydney acupuncturist, David Tai, flips his hands through a photo album in his reception room, showing one after another the many hundreds of patients he has treated over the past few years. He's a tiny man, dressed neatly in a suit, waistcoat and tie. His face radiates absolute joy.""This one had nervous complaints,"" he says about one patient, ""And this one bad digestion. This one here had a bad knee from soccer."" But the most dramatic, showing two paraplegic patients, are startling. The first photos show them as pale and listless in their wheelchairs. Three gruelling years later, after three sessions a week, they grin from the album with 1,000-watt smiles, standing proudly on their new calipers.Tai says that, in Chinese medicine, acupuncture has always been a part of treating spinal-cord injury. He explains it this way: acupuncture needles can reconnect the damaged nerves with the spinal cord and the central nervous system, and eventually return the vertebrae to their correct positions. With the right treatment, he claims the patient should be able to walk again.""The acupuncture needle is the tool, just as the knife is used by the surgeon. The result is dependent upon their knowledge of the human body and the skill they possess in diagnosing the problem,"" he says.Although Tai is certain his treatment helped his patients, he admits it will take science many years to prove it. ""They've been trying to prove the existence of energy meridians for 40 years in China and they can't. We know they're there, but they just can't show it.""There are, however, several other areas in which scientific certainty is not so elusive. At UTS, researchers have conducted a study showing that the practice relieves stress and anxiety, Rogers says. In particular, it reduces the blood pressure of those suffering a variety of debilitating, stress-related symptoms, such as insomnia, irritability and difficulty in communicating.At the Victoria University of Technology in Melbourne, research shows that acupuncture can alleviate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, according to the course co-ordinator, Dr Kerry Watson. He says the research, completed by masters student Dr Deyuan Wang, shows that the tension, anxiety and feelings of bloatedness associated with PMS are alleviated after six to 10 weekly treatments.New mothers having trouble breastfeeding have also been given acupuncture in the first month after giving birth to see if it enhances their ability to breastfeed for longer periods.The study, still to be completed, is showing that acupuncture may enhance the production of milk and help the mothers relax as they feed.Registration is one of the major hurdles that acupuncture still has to overcome. There are still concerns that anyone can practise and that unscrupulous practitioners who do not use disposable needles may transmit hepatitis or HIV.""Up until now, a lot of alternative health practitioners have tried to add it into their box of health tricks, which means the public can be treated by people who are not adequately trained,"" Rogers says.Having acupuncture registered still means ""people can stick needles in each other until the cows come home, but you won't be allowed to call yourself an acupuncturist unless you've trained as one"", she says.At the Health Ministers Conference in June, it is expected moves will begin to register practitioners in Queensland and Victoria, although it may take several years for this to click into place. Rogers predicts NSW will follow.Although there are private rebates, the real barometer of the acceptance of acupuncture will be support from Medicare. ""Hopefully, it will eventually become part of the hospital system and become more accepted that way,"" she says."
234,1235.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Old ways new hit - Chinese remedy proves popular," MORE Coast people are choosing reflexology, acupuncture and massage to treat the aches and pains of their daily lives.Alternative medicine is becoming a popular and acceptable remedy, spurred on by the recent opening of a Chinese Medical centre in Erina Fair. The centre specialises in the old traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, massage, reflexology and cupping.  Owner Robert Liang said his clientele had doubled since he opened the practice five months ago. ""At first we were quiet but now more people are finding out about us. I think it's word of mouth,"" he said. ""People are returning for follow up treatments and we now have a lot regulars."" The medical centre now treats up to 40 people a day. Mr Liang decided to open the Erina Fair store because he saw an opportunity for alternative medical remedies in the area. ""I don't think there are many other Chinese medicine alternatives around. I thought it would be good to start in Erina Fair,"" he said. Mr Liang also owns a similar centre in Penrith. ""The Penrith one is very popular,"" he said. ""I'm hoping the same thing will happen in Erina."" Mr Liang said massage was the remedy most people initially came in for. ""I do Chinese traditional medicine and treatment massage,"" he said. ""We massage with the clothes on so I think that appeals to some people."" Chinese massage is used to treat stiff neck, lower back pain, migraine, tennis elbow, stress and tension. Acupuncture and reflexology are also used to target problem areas. Mr Liang said pressure points were used in both instances to identify and treat aches and pains in other parts of the body. ""When we massage we try to find pressure points on people's bodies and work them,"" he said. ""There are different pressure points for different problems. If you've got lower back pain there are pressure points on your lower back, which can ease it. ""In Chinese medical science we believe internal organs can be targeted by pressure points too."" Mr Liang said cupping was a less well-known technique, which was gaining popularity. ""One of the not so well known Chinese traditional treatments is cupping.

Acupuncture is the Ancient Chinese method of unblocking energy channels to relieve pain, using tiny pins on key points of the body.Thousands of years ago the skin was pierced with fine stone pins; these days, the stone needles have been replaced by stainless steel ones.Chinese medicine, derived thousands of years ago, is going through a renaissance in Western society today as an alternative and complement to traditional Western healing. The Chinese used herbs, plants and animals to produce their medicines, and roots, flowers, leaves and seeds are still used in most Chinese medicines. Cupping is another ancient technique on the rise today, which sees glass or plastic cups placed at specific points on the back and suction-pumped to create a vacuum effect. The Chinese are believed to have hollowed out animal horns and bamboo or pottery cups and sucked the air from them, before placing the cups on the body.Devotees say the technique unblocks lymph nodes, relieves localised back pain and treats chest infections, asthma and digestive ailments.Early Chinese scientists based their medical practice on the teachings of the Daoist religion. Their wholistic approach attempted to make the body work harmoniously.There is evidence of scientific and mathematical observations being made about 1750BC in the form of symbols engraved on animal and tortoise bones.As well as ritual information, the bones contained astrological and astronomical observations about solar and lunar eclipses, novas, exploding stars and sunspots. These were not rediscovered until Galileo's time in the 16th century AD.A detailed astronomical chart carved in stone has also been attributed to the Chinese.A less savoury practice was the use of ""oracle bones"" in a deadly kind of divination. Mystics and priests used the bones to communicate with their ancestors about the future, sometimes sacrificing people in the process.The abacus was used to find answers in a more practical, mathematical sense. It was a very simple but effective calculator used by merchants to keep their records, and its use has continued for centuries. The abacus seen most commonly today is a Chinese abacus.Pinpointing the results of an ancient treatmentTraditional Chinese medicine draws on anatomy, physiology and diagnosis. It views the healthy body as a balancing act between the opposite aspects of yin and yang.For example, yin equates to water or serenity and yang is fire or action. Disease results when either one is deficient or surplus, affecting a person's natural balance.Acupuncture points lie along channels, known as meridians, in the body and Qi (vital energy) flows along them. Disease alters Qi's flow and needles are inserted to correct its path, promoting good spiritual, emotional and physical health.The needles are left for 15 to 30 minutes, then manipulated. In contemporary Western medicine, acupuncture is used to treat joint, bone and muscle pain.In conjunction with complementary remedies it can relieve dental, lower back and migraine pain. Asthmatics have reported benefits from using it too.Studies prove the treatment releases endorphins into the nervous system.Key areas in acupunctureGOVERNING VESSEL:Relates to the ""yang"" meridian.CONCEPTION VESSEL:Relates to the ""yin"" meridian.PERICARDIUM MERIDIAN(YIN): ""The heart's ambassador.""

The traditional Chinese medicine practice of ""cupping"" gained widespread publicity recently when photographs appeared of the Oscar-winning actress with large round welts on her back and shoulders.  Now several members of our swimming team, including Olympic 1500m champion Grant Hackett, are sporting similar red welts as they count down to the Olympic competition starting on Saturday Sprinters Ashley Callus and Brett Hawke have also had the distinctive marks on their shoulders and backs as they trained at the Olympic pool in Athens in the past two days. Chinese medicine practitioner Gordon Hepburn has been part of the swimming team's support staff since the 2001 world championships in Fukuoka. He says cupping is effective in drawing unwanted energy from the body and helping to ease pain and discomfort.Continued Page 74From Back PageThe process involves setting alight a swab soaked in methylated spirits. This is put into the cup to draw the oxygen out of it so the cup will stick on to the skin by suction. ""The reason I use it is because it serves as a good adjunct to conventional therapy to alleviate muscle spasms, aches and pains, muscle tightness,"" Hepburn said. ""The most common place for swimmers to experience this is in the shoulders, back, hip flexors."" Hepburn was originally hired as a masseur but has become the resident alternative therapist."

241,1242.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,When ancient balms cure our modern ills,"Traditional therapies believed to rid the body of toxins are increasingly being used to counter our modern lifestyle, writes Erica WatsonDETOXING has become the buzzword of the 21st century, with stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow leading the rush to try new ways of removing chemical nasties from the body.When the Academy Award winner stepped on to the red carpet for a New York film premiere in 2004 sporting strange circular bruises on her back, it emerged the marks resulted from cupping, an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine thought to play arole in helping the body rid itself of toxins.Famous or not, we are always on the look out for ways to feel better and live longer. And why not? The modern lifestyle is tiring and stressful, we breath polluted air and are constantly exposed to chemicals contained in everything from the clothes we wear to the furniture we sit on. Frantic schedules also have an adverse affect on our diets.Sallow skin, poor digestion and low energy levels could signal it is time for an overhaul. Cutting out alcohol, cigarettes, refined sugar and saturated fats should be a priority. And slowly increasing exercise should follow.For a further boost, it may also be worth exploring complementary detox therapies.According to traditional Chinese medicine afree flow of qi (pronounced chi), or energy, is essential forgood health.Tran Ong (pictured on page 29), a specialist in Chinese herbal medicine says acupuncture, herbs and cupping, all of which concentrate on improving the flow of qi, have become popular ways to improve health and wellbeing.Practised for thousands of years, these treatments focus on the major organs such as the liver, kidneys and digestive system to help them function at their peak.Working on the meridians of the body, acupuncture uses fine needles, placed in specific points, to clear energy blockages.``It really harmonises the body on a chemical level,'' says Ong.One of the oldest medicinal practices, acupuncture has been used to treat everything from dermatitis to digestive problems, neurological conditions and fertility issues.Cupping is used to stimulate the flow of blood and oxygen throughout the body. Heated glass or bamboo cups are placed on the skin forming a vacuum that draws blood to the surface and activates the lymphatic system.It has been used to treat colds, flu, aches and pains as well as promote health and wellbeing.``It really moves blood to the surface of the area to help it relax,'' says Ong. ``Where there's blood there's oxygen and that actually helps to detoxify because of the movement.''Specialty Chinese herbs, particularly those that assist the liver or major organs, are often used to supplement treatments.Ong says an approach tailored to the individual will provide much better results than a general detoxprogram.``It's better to be specific because everyone's lifestyle differs and the body's reaction to the lifestyle differs,'' she says.``Your physical signs and symptoms will then dictate what sort of vitamins and minerals you may require. We all need vitamins and minerals, granted, but what and how much is more the main issue.''Natural therapies that specifically work on the lymphatic system, which has a critical role in the function of the immune system, are also becoming popular. Lymphatic drainage massage, for example, uses light touch to stimulate the lymph glands and draw fluid and toxins away from the tissue.Lumologie takes the traditional treatment one step further through the use of specialist machines to stimulate lymph flow. Developed in France, it is also used to treat cellulite.Practitioner Leonie Phillips, from the Body Contour Centre, says the therapy also boosts oxygen levels in the cells which helps the body repair itself. However, it is not a magic fix and must be complemented with a good diet and sensible exercise program.``If you're not going to do that you're wasting your time and money,'' Phillips says.Client Alex Wilson, 21, credits lumologie massage with making a huge difference to her health and wellbeing. She says it has also helped her shed 25kg.``I have far more energy and my skin glows more than it used to,'' she says. ``I used to have a sunken look in my face and really patchy skin on my legs.''Fluid retention and poor circulation have also been reversed, she says.A poor diet or busy lifestyle are not the only things that can trigger the need for a detox. The environment also plays a major role.Dr Fiona Hunter, a general practitioner at Surry Hills practice U Clinic, says everyday life exposes us to various toxins in one form or another. However, she says that apart from acute poisoning, the effect on our bodies remains largely unknown.``Everybody will be able to tolerate a certain amount of exposure to toxins,'' she says.``Your basic health, genetic make-up, how well your liver works and how many different toxins you are exposed to is going to influence how able your body is to cope,'' she says.Hunter says that despite the lack of hard evidence detoxing can have its merits in certain situations.``If you are in a group where you have chronic health problems, allergy, immune imbalances, autoimmune diseases like lupus, diabetes, asthma, eczema, cancers, any of the illnesses where toxins have been implicated, inthat case there may be merit depending of overall health,'' she says.``If you're healthy and you have a low toxic exposure there's probably not going to be a huge amount of advantage doing a focused detox program.''Quick-fix programs, such as heavily marketed detox diets, offer little benefit, particularly as it takes some time to regulate the enzymes in the body.Money is much better spent on good quality, preferably organic, food as well as those that are unprocessed and without added flavourings. When shopping, examine the numbers on the ingredients list and avoid foods laden with added chemicals.Small changes can make a huge difference when it comes to feeling good. Diet, exercise and reducing chemicals in the home, may just be all it takes to make every day a detox.A change of diet is the best detox plan aboutPACKAGED diets are marketed as one of the easiest and cheapest ways to detox. Readily available on the shelves of pharmacies and health-food stores, some promise results will be achieved in as little as seven days.One of the most widely known is the Lemon Detox, or Master Cleanse, diet.Although invented more than 50 years ago, it was not until celebrities such as Beyonce Knowles and Angelina Jolie attributed their svelte figures to the program that its stock began to rise.But while devotees swear by its miraculous effects that supposedly result from ridding the body of toxins, many medical experts have slammed it as a potentially dangerous quick fix. But it is not the only detox program onthe market.Many over-the-counter preparations also promise easy ways to cleanse the colon, boost liver function and overhaul digestion.But do any of these programs actually work and are they worth the investment?``There's very little evidence to back up buying these detox kits or herbs,'' nutritionist Joanna McMillan Price says.Although they might work on the psyche, McMillan Price says there is no scientific reason to undergo a detox.``We certainly need to give our livers abreak from alcohol if you drink but we don't need to do the full detox,'' she says.If it is time to clean up your act, then reassessing diet and lifestyle is the best, and often the cheapest and easiest, way to start.``I think people grossly underestimate the power of lifestyle change and the power of diet,'' McMillan Price says.``Many people don't know how good they could feel and how good they can look and how well they could perform in their daily tasks if only they ate well and moved a little more.''And to ensure the best results McMillan Price says: ``Don't try to be too strict.''"
242,1243.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Healthy respect for Chinese medicine ," Interest in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is flourishing in Australia as our multicultural society embraces a system of medicine stretching back over 3000 years. Nearly one in four adults have now at least dipped their toes into the small pool of therapies that make up TCM -a reflection of changing health attitudes and practices in the Western world. ""Westerners are finally beginning to appreciate the health benefits of Chinese Medicine,"" says Sydney TCM doctor, Qi Xin Chen. ""In particular, acupuncture -a foundation therapy of TCM -is widely accepted.""  TCM seeks to restore the body's balance and harmony. It recognises, first, that our bodies are superbly equipped to resist disease and heal themselves. But when disease does take hold, or an injury occurs, the first instinct of TCM practitioners is to see what might be done to strengthen resistance and stimulate natural healing, so as to quickly restore homeostasis or balance. ""The body is the hero -not the treatment,"" says Dr Chen. ""If we can restore balance through the treatment, the body will quickly go about healing itself."" Dr Chen, formerly from the Chinese province of Fujian, holds a degree in orthodox medicine and a post-graduate degree in TCM. For 15 years he has used his integrated knowledge to treat patients for all kinds of illnesses with a special interest in cancer and is now helping to educate Australians about this traditional system of medicine. Along with acupuncture, herbal therapy is a fundamental part of TCM. Dr Chen says recent adverse publicity about the potential harmful side-effects of these potent natural substances has been misleading. ""When administered correctly, by an experienced practitioner, Chinese herbs are safe and efficient.They present few side-effects and address a wide variety of ailments,"" he says. ""This is not to say, however, that people can take herbs haphazardly -they are potent natural medicines and people are wise to seek the advice of a qualified practitioner before using them."" Dr Chen says empirical data accumulated over 3000 years has been gradually supplemented by modern research techniques, proving the effectiveness of acupuncture and revealing the pharmacological values of the herbs. ""The continuous improvement has led to a rich and powerful system of healing,"" he says. ""More than 5000 herbs are used in Chinese medicine, although there are about 1000 herbs most commonly used."" Key concepts in the philosophy of this system of medicine are Qi and the Yin/Yang polarity. Under the Chinese medical model, Qi is life force: our vital functional energy. Yin/Yang theory is a way of looking at nature that divides everything into two opposite yet mutually dependent aspects. Everything in life may be looked at as having a Yin and a Yang side. In TCM philosophy, health is determined by the ability of the body to preserve a balanced and harmonious internal environment, and in particular to maintain the flow of Qi, the vital energy. Qi is responsible for physical, mental, emotional and spiritual processes, and flows in streams of energy called meridians. TCM uses four main healing modalities: 1) Herbal and food therapy, 2) Acupuncture and Moxibustion (burning of compressed mugwort near specific points on the body), 3) Tui Na, or Chinese massage therapy; and 4) Exercise, such as Tai Ch'i and Qi Gong, aimed to build up Qi in the body. (Diet in TCM is a standard part of any therapeutic program, and not just a reference to weight control). ""In terms of health, the Qi of the body must be kept flowing freely. If Qi does not flow, pain or discomfort results. Yin and Yang must always be in balance; if they are not, disease results,"" Dr Chen says. ""The goal of treatment in Chinese medicine is to regulate the movement of Qi and balance Yin and Yang."" Since being in Australia, Dr Chen has observed imbalances specific to the Australian way of life. He says a higher rate of cancer than recorded in his native China can be attributed to dietary factors and the proliferation of agricultural chemicals and some pharmaceutical drugs, as well as the fact our soils are lacking in important trace elements, such as selenium. Acupuncture is a well-known therapy in which super-fine needles are inserted into specific points along the meridians. When the needles are inserted into the points where Qi is stagnating, a current will be stimulated, similar to an electric current, to galvanise the stuck energy to flow, thus restoring balance and harmony to the system. ""A qualified TCM practitioner is trained to assess where your Qi is stuck, and to stimulate the appropriate points and restore the healing flow,"" says Judy James, executive officer for the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association. Ms James says there are now 1500 qualified TCM practitioners and 2.8 million consultations annually in Australia and numbers are rising. ""Around 30 per cent of our member practitioners are ethnic Chinese and they have brought a wealth of knowledge to this country,"" Ms James says. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of TCM is the diagnosis. Apart from listening to your story and symptoms, the TCM practitioner will ask you to stick your tongue out, where they will assess its colour and coating and relate their observations to internal organ dysfunction. They will also feel your pulse where 28 different vibrations will give an insight into your general health condition. ""Chinese medicine is especially beneficial for those people with chronic disorders,"" says Dr Chen. ""It is a non-invasive system of medicine and one which recognises that the natural healing force within each of us is the greatest force in getting well.""*  The Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association can help you find a qualified TCM practitioner in your area, details phone (1800 025 334).

James Flowers, president of the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association, yesterday said the proposal would radically improve the standard of practice. ""If you have a recognised standard, consumers can feel safe,"" he said. ""At the moment, anyone off the street can set up an acupuncture practice, and they do. ""Having a set standard for education and qualifications will mean the public can choose someone who's reliable."" However Dr Andrew Dix, registrar of the NSW Medical Board, said registration of acupuncturists, already available in Victoria, would be complicated and should ""be approached with caution"". The NSW Health Department is considering approval for a traditional Chinese medicine unit at Liverpool Hospital, the first of its kind in Australia. The proposal is co-ordinated by Professor Felix Wong of Liverpool Hospital in collaboration with the Universities of NSW and Western Sydney. A spokeswoman for the hospital said the unit would offer ""a range of Chinese medicine"".

244,1245.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,60 seconds in the 9to5 of a LASER ACUPUNCTURIST - Shining a light on flow of life,"LaserQuit acupuncturist Lara Jarzabek mixes traditional Chinese medicine with 21st century technology. Jarzabek uses laser acupuncture therapy to help people control cravings and quit smoking.( Q ) What is a standard day for you?( A ) I see between six and 14 patients in a day. Monday is usually when we start the treatment and it's about 45 minutes per treatment. I run the patient through what the treatment entails and we do a few measurements, take the patient's weight and blood pressure and attach them to a machine which tells us how much carbon-monoxide is in their lungs. Then we do the treatment which takes 22 to 30 minutes. I do that again and again for each patient. On Tuesday or Wednesday I see the patients again to find out how they're going. It's a slightly shorter treatment because you don't have to do the preliminary discussion. A big part of my job is instilling confidence in the program because people don't know much about acupuncture. It is important for them to understand how this is going to help. ( Q ) How does acupuncture work?( A ) It can sound a little voodoo-ish. Basically the body is made up of its physical parts and energy channels. In acupuncture, the channels the energy runs along are called meridians. The idea is that whenever there is an illness or a disease the energy channels aren't flowing correctly, they're flowing too much, too little or there is a blockage. Acupuncture uses the body's own natural flow to unblock energy channels and the body readjusts itself to get better again.( Q ) How does it work with lasers?( A ) It's the frequency of the laser that stimulates the point in the same way a needle does. Chinese medicine has been around for about 4000 years and has been in its current form where needles are used for about 2000 years, so it is always evolving. They used to use bamboo and bone needles and now we use single-use surgical steel needles, so it is a natural progression to start using lasers.( Q ) Do you also practise traditional acupuncture?( A ) I do a little traditional acupuncture on the days I don't work at LaserQuit. It's a good idea to keep those skills honed. I work three or four days a week at LaserQuit and about two days a week at my own practice.( Q ) What made you decide to get into traditional Chinese medicine?( A ) Towards the end of high school I decided that if I was going to finish I'd better have a direction so I researched everything I was interested in. I had been to China in 1984 with my family and had acupuncture from the age of nine. I really like the holistic aspect of acupuncture and the focus on health instead of disease. My early exposure to Chinese culture and acupuncture paved the way. I was interested in health, the body and how it works.( Q ) Why were you having acupuncture as a child?( A ) If you go to the doctor with a cold, they say go to bed and don't give you anything for because they can't help with a virus. If you go to an acupuncturist they give you acupuncture, Chinese medicine which is generally herbs, and you get better in a couple of days.( Q ) How did you become an acupuncturist?( A ) I did a degree at the University of Technology, Sydney, a bachelor of health science basically. It was a new program when I graduated and it's difficult to find employment as an acupuncturist -- you usually have to be your own boss and have your own business, which is tricky when you've just come out of university. LaserQuit was a good opportunity."

Researcher Jann Mehmet has begun recruiting subjects for her study at the University of Technology, Sydney, to begin on July 3.  ""In 1997 after nearly 10 years of work with women experiencing infertility I decided to research male infertility in detail,"" Ms Mehmet said. ""I found that on many occasions, in as little as six weeks after acupuncture and herbal medicine, significant improvements could be verified by analysis."" In a retrospective study of 9000 treatments over three years, Ms Mehmet found 45 per cent of couples she treated had been classified by doctors as ""sub-fertile"". ""Further assessment found that 50 per cent of this group experienced sub-fertility as a result of a male factor that had been poorly diagnosed and not thoroughly investigated,"" she said."

It was only when she was in her late 30s, and with three children, that she decided to pursue her passion and see how far it would take her.The Sydney-based Yallamas enrolled as a mature-aged student for the bachelor of health science in traditional Chinese medicine at University of Technology, Sydney. The four-year, full-time course covered everything from acupuncture to herbal medicine, with instruction in techniques such as tui na massage, cupping and gua sha (a skin-scraping technique). ""It was terrific but very intense,"" Yallamas says. ""Almost from day one we would practise sticking needles into one another. I was never one of those people who were afraid of needles, so that wasn't a problem, but some of the students were a bit funny about it."" As a student sheobserved qualified practitioners and helped with the running of the Chinese medicine clinic based at the university.She says the main focus of her degree was acupuncture; an ancient practice dating to at least 100BC. The theory behind it is that needles are inserted into the body to cause changes in the pattern of the patient's energy system (qi). Acupuncture has been used to treat a range of issues from pain and fertility to migraines, nausea, and osteoarthritis.In Yallamas' final year of study, she began practical training with Health Space in Rozelle. She also applied to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to register as a clinical acupuncturist.The training and registration led to a full-time position with Health Space and she has been working there since February.""It's been great,"" she says. ""I look forward to coming to work because I spend my day helping people to manage their health. I've even had children visit me for treatment for conditions such as asthma and insomnia."" Yallamas is employed as a subcontractor for Health Space, which provides a room and marketing support. She has no immediate plans to set up her own practice, although she would be qualified to do so.""I enjoy being part of a multi-modality group because I don't feel so isolated ... I'm surrounded by like-minded people."" Yallamas says she is required to keep up to date with the latest studies and information. She regularly attends conferences and training courses to earn professional development points.She says an acupuncturist can earn from $60 to $100 an hour.Associate Professor Chris Zaslawski is the program director at UTS' traditional Chinese medicine course. He has been practising acupuncture and herbal medicine for 30 years and is a researcher in the area.""There's no question that the interest in Chinese medicine has grown over the past five years,"" Zaslawski says. ""There are currently six accredited educational programs in Australia including our course at UTS."" He attributes the growing demand for the subject partially to the national regulation of Chinese medicine three years ago. ""Before that time, anybody could call themselves a practitioner,"" he says.""The regulation has probably contributed to the increasing student demand for Chinese medicine programs and a higher public profile of the profession.""He is also seeing a high proportion of international students and second-generation Chinese students enrolling in the course. The acceptance and increasing use of Chinese medicine in Australia may also be another factor.Only a handful of Chinese medical practitioners are employed in the public and private hospital systems, but Zaslawski believes that will change.""As the evidence for the efficacy of Chinese medicine mounts, we may see our graduates employed in the system,"" he says."
247,1248.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Medicine gets a feel for Orient,"AFTER more than 2500 years, traditional Chinese medicines and therapies are finding a place in the once-sceptical world of Western emergency departments and medical laboratories. The Chinese Medicine department at RMIT's School of Health Sciences, the largest provider of Chinese medicine studies in Australia, is collaborating with a range of Victorian hospitals to trial the use and benefits of ancient remedies such as acupuncture and ginseng. Acupuncture has been trialled on patients suffering acute pain in emergency rooms at the Alfred, Northern, Epworth and Cabrini Hospitals, while ginseng - a root believed to increase stamina and quality of life since the 11th century - is being tested to relieve symptoms of chronic lung disease at Box Hill Hospital and Austin Health.  Professor Charlie Xue, director of the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Research Program at RMIT's Health Innovations Research Institute said the projects aimed to bring together the best of Eastern and Western approaches to health. He said that while there were continuing doubts about many so-called complementary and alternative therapies, RMIT believed Chinese medicine should be developed ""on very strong scientific underpinnings"". ""By applying scientific rigor to our analysis of Chinese treatments, we can share the fruits of knowledge that has built up over 2500 years,"" he said. These trials were examples of how Chinese and conventional therapies could co-exist. The acupuncture trial, which began at the Northern in 2009, aims to compare the practice against standard pharmacological responses in emergency patients with acute pain from migraines, ankle sprains and lower back pain. The Alfred's Chinese medicine practitioner Shefton Parker said doctors welcomed the trial. When it began last year director of emergency services De Villiers Smit said a third of the world's population relied on acupuncture as their prime medical treatment and studies indicated it relieved pain by promoting the release of neurotransmitters and endorphins into the body. ""Acupuncture is known to have some effect on pain, but in an acute scenario it's never been tested,"" said Mr Parker. ""Typically most acupuncture trials have been done in a more chronic setting, where people have suffered, say, migraines. ""There's a lot of patients who present in hospitals with pain and there's really only one method of treatment which is analgesia and which some patients have reactions to or are contraindicated. For them it provides an alternative."" One aspect of the trial is to see if acupuncture can reduce waiting times and reduce the pressure on doctors, he said. Professor Xue said ginseng trials looked at whether the herb could improve lung function for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a term for diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. He said there had been comprehensive research into ginseng and its traditional use matched well with the symptoms of lung disease. ""We want to look into three things: can the herbal medicine reduce the progression of the disease, can we also help people improve their quality of life - and when people have later stage COPD their life is miserable - and can it partially recover lung function."""
248,1249.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chinese puzzle; SELF,"Western medicine can't always explain how it works, but treatments from the East have gained acceptance. Paula Goodyer reports.Faced with acute pain, most people head for the nearest hospital. For many chronic conditions, however, more than 5 per cent of Australians now use traditional Chinese medicine, according to Professor Charlie Xue, head of the division of Chinese Medicine at RMIT University.Western medicine is some way from wholeheartedly embracing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), but there have been moves to incorporate aspects of it. ""When I came to Australia from China 12 years ago, the medical profession didn't want to know about Chinese medicine, but now it's more open-minded,"" Xue says.In Xue's case, this open-mindedness has seen his treatments incorporated into an emergency medicine setting. ""My team now provides acupuncture to treat patients in pain at the emergency department at Melbourne's Northern Hospital - if we'd suggested this 10 years ago, people would have laughed at us."" The World Health Organisation has acknowledged the role such medicine plays in health treatments, and in 2002 launched a strategy to gather more evidence on its safety and efficacy. That same year, Australia's first Chinese Medicine Clinical Research Centre opened in Liverpool Hospital to run clinical trials of herbal medicine and acupuncture for gynaecological problems.The trials included research into the effect of Chinese herbs on endometriosis. Sydney policewoman Gina*, 32, took part in the trials and, after a decade of debilitating period pain, no longer juggles her shifts to ensure her time off coincides with her periods. ""The first period I had after taking the herbs was much less painful, and by the second month, there was no pain at all,"" she says. ""It's been life-altering.""Meanwhile, with two unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilisation, only one functioning fallopian tube and her 41st birthday looming, Joanne Day wasn't optimistic about conceiving - especially when a doctor diagnosed problems with her new partner's sperm. ""The specialist said the only way we'd conceive was with IVF, but I didn't want to go through that again,"" says Day, who instead consulted Jann Mehmet, a TCM practitioner. After a few months of regular acupuncture and a healthier diet, she conceived at 41 and had a baby at 42.""The word is out that acupuncture can treat muscular-skeletal problems, irregular periods, coughs and colds, infertility and many other conditions,"" says North Shore practitioner Melissa Scott. At first people came as a last resort. Now we find that people who have success with Chinese medicine often come with subsequent problems, rather than go to a GP first. What draws many people is that they're wary of the side effects of some Western medication.""Drugs are often Band-Aids that treat symptoms but not the underlying cause - with eczema, for instance, you can be given cortisone to reduce inflammation but it doesn't address the cause. TCM on the other hand can help by strengthening the immune system and digestive function.""Few Western-trained doctors refer patients to a TCM practitioner, though one doctor now refers children with eczema to Scott for pediatric massage - an alternative to acupuncture for children who are afraid of needles.The barriers to more doctors referring patients for TCM include lack of registration - only Victoria has a registration system for its practitioners - and lack of evidence for its benefits. Still, Xue says, it is the subject of increasing study and there's some evidence that acupuncture helps treat headaches, period pain, back pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Studies suggest it may improve IVF's success, though it is unclear why.""It may increase blood flow to the uterus,"" says Dr Caroline Smith, who has conducted a study of acupuncture and IVF through the University of Adelaide. ""It needs more research, but we know acupuncture does no harm and may increase women's chances of success.""As for Chinese herbal medicine, its acceptance lags behind acupuncture, which now attracts a Medicare rebate provided it is done by a medical doctor trained in acupuncture. But Australian research has found that Chinese herbs can slow liver damage caused by hepatitis C, and animal studies at Sydney's Garvan Institute of Medical Research suggest a Chinese herb, berberine, shows promise for diabetes by helping to reduce blood sugar levels.At the University of Technology in Sydney, trials of a Chinese herbal formula in rats has found it reduces the risky symptoms of metabolic syndrome - pot belly, high blood pressure, high blood fats and insulin resistance.Evidence to support TCM is building, yet its mystique persists because it's hard to find Western medical explanations for how it works. Unlike Western medicine, which often reduces the cause of illness to a specific organ or system in the body, TCM attributes disease to an imbalance affecting many different parts of the body. It holds that good health depends on a strong flow of an energy source called ""chi"" coursing through meridians or pathways in the body - we get sick when pathways become blocked, preventing the flow of chi.This may have its own logic - but X-rays can't detect a blocked meridian and there's no test to measure chi.But Western medicine could explain why some research suggests acupuncture may improve polycystic ovarian syndrome, the hormonal disorder affecting 5 to 10 per cent of Australian women.With this disorder, ""the levels of male hormones are increased, disrupting menstruation and fertility"", says Dr Danforn Lim of the faculty of medicine at the University of NSW, who is studying the use of acupuncture to treat the syndrome. ""Studies have found acupuncture helps menstruation and fertility return to normal."" This may be due to acupuncture's effect on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Research suggests acupuncture raises levels of beta-endorphins, the body's natural pain-killers produced by the hypothalamus, which controls the hormone-regulating pituitary gland, Lim explains.As for the effects of herbal medicine on period pain, about 55 trials from Japan, Taiwan and China say it's effective, says researcher Dr Xiaoshu Zhu, of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney.According to Chinese medicine, herbs work by clearing blocked meridians and strengthening the reproductive system, she says, but a Western explanation might be that they have an effect on hormones, relax uterine muscles or reduce prostaglandins, chemicals thought to cause period pain.There are parallels in Chinese and Western medicine, Zhu says, but ""you can't always make sense of Chinese medicine in Western medicine terms"".As with others trained in both practices, she believes learning both gives practitioners more skills to draw on. Or as Xue says, ""Neither is perfect - but if we can get the best of both worlds, we get the best for patients.""*Name has been changedCan acupuncture provide relief from hepatitis C symptoms? Working in a drug rehabilitation unit, Sydney acupuncturist Christine Berle worked with people who had hepatitis C - the chronic viral disease infecting the livers of 242,000 people in Australia, and causing 16,000 new infections annually. When her patients went for routine tests after a few weeks of acupuncture, their liver function had dramatically improved. Now Berle, a postgraduate student at UTS, is conducting a trial to see whether 12 weeks of acupuncture has any effect on liver function in people with hepatitis C. The drug treatment available to clear the virus does not work for everyone."

The director of the college of traditional Chinese medicine at the University of Technology in Sydney, Chris Zaslawski, is a strong believer that Eastern and Western medicine each have a significant role to play in modern treatment. ""The four-year degree program incorporates both acupuncture and herbal medicine, but it has a sizeable component of Western sciences and research methodology,"" he said.He said universities provided a quality environment with a scientific base - his is run by the school of medical and molecular sciences - which could not be achieved externally.""Obviously access to an anatomy lab would be very difficult outside the university sector, so you're starting to put people at risk if you're not giving them enough skills and knowledge to insert hunks of needle into areas where there is potential for damage, so the only way you can address that concern is by ensuring they have a high skill of anatomy knowledge.""Studies in natural and complementary medicine at the school of health and sciences at Southern Cross University will continue to flourish, with no question of cutbacks, said Stephen Myers, director of the NatMed-Research Unit.He agreed that all health disciplines were under scrutiny.""The suggestion that all complementary medicine is not evidence-based is probably correct, but not all conventional medicine is evidence-based either. Conventional medicine is under just as much a challenge as complementary medicine is. Removing these courses is likely to detrimentally affect public health, not improve it.""However, Alastair MacLennan, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Adelaide, said the credibility of universities is under threat from what he calls hocus pocus medicine. ""Legitimate science and research in those universities are undermined by nonsensical practices. They are basically courses that earn money for the university, and give you respectability if you have a degree in pseudo-science. Some call themselves doctors but the public is not good at differentiating.""But Chinese Medicine Board of Australia chairman Charlie Xue, who is also head of RMIT University's school of health sciences, said such comments were ""inappropriate because there is scientific evidence in some of the practices of acupuncture and herbal medicine, and he will need to look into the evidence before he makes those comments"".He said registration, and universities' teaching programs in complementary medicine, will be used to ensure public safety.""It's setting up educational standards by registering the practitioners who meet the requirements for assessment. And it's the same mechanism that will be used in other health care professions under the national law.""

250,1251.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,The China syndrome,"Chinese medicine, introduced to Victoria during the gold rush last century, has been given a fresh start. STEVE DOW reports in the last part of a series on alternative medicine.THE first thing one notices about Chinese medical practitioner Daniel Godel is that he is not Chinese. He is Romanian-born.One would think this might help to explain why he set up a Chinese acupuncture and herbal clinic in gentle, gentrified North Carlton. After all, the strong link between communist systems meant that traditional Chinese medicine was widely practised in his home country.Not so. Godel's family resettled in Australia and he simply found in his early 20s that he had an affinity with oriental massage, and this natural interest broadened. Eleven years later, his corner store in Rathdowne Street looks something like a Chinese herbal version of a Darrell Lea chocolate shop. Dozens of plastic containers line the walls, filled with raw chunks and chips and twists of herbs that are weighed, mixed in assorted combinations, and wrapped in butchers' paper like fish and chips.The room behind Daniel Godel's dispensary resembles any doctor's surgery. A crisp, white linen sheet lies on a bed and books line the walls, alongside pills containing herbal mixtures for patients too faint-hearted to brew the raw stuff.Even the most enthusiastic acolytes of Chinese medicine say it is exceedingly vile to taste, and putrid-smelling.Godel's spoken manner is soft, clipped in a Chinese manner that is a legacy from his six months' internship in China with established practitioners. He spent four years studying for his diploma of acupuncture, concurrent with a medical sciences course at La Trobe University. Then followed a two-year graduate diploma in Chinese herbs and a graduate diploma in clinical acupuncture.Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture is gaining ground in this country. Even the conservative Victorian Health Minister, Marie Tehan, appears to be impressed. Last September, Mrs Tehan gave $50,000 towards research into Chinese medicine in the state, and she waxed lyrical about its uses.Victoria has a long history of the practice of Chinese medicine going back to the gold rush days, Mrs Tehan said during the announcement, and it clearly still has relevance for many people today. There is a ""widespread and growing acceptance"" of Chinese medicine practice among Victorians, she said.The state's move appears to be prompted by the lack of a registration system for Chinese medical practitioners. Indeed, anyone can set up with a pile of acupuncture needles and start jabbing people (there have been cases of punctured lungs settled out of court), or handing out herbal concoctions.Godel and another Melbourne practitioner, Shelley Beer, hope that the move has also been prompted by a concern for illness prevention - that Chinese medicine may keep people out of hospitals.Last November, Chinese medicine practitioners and scholars formed the Australian Chinese Medicine Education and Research Council to develop educational and clinical standards and promote local research, as well as public safety.Shelley Beer, meanwhile, has begun a trial of Chinese herbal medicine on menopausal symptoms, specifically on hot flushes.Daniel Godel says Chinese medicine goes way beyond the presenting symptoms, looking more philosophically at a person's life.He takes the pulse, looks at the tongue - the mirror image of what is going on inside the body - and listens intently to the patient, asking questions about other problems.It is an attempt to find out the wider problems going on in the body, the ""pattern of disharmony"". One would not, for example, receive treatment for the upper respiratory tract in isolation from the lower respiratory tract. Metaphors for what happens in nature are used to describe what is happening to the patient.""For example,"" he says, ""how does a woman understand menstrual pain beyond the fact she is experiencing it? I give her the landscape or the imagery of what is going on.""A woman with painful periods would thus be described as being ""cold"" in the uterus, causing her blood to slow down, just as in nature, coldness causes contraction and slows things down. Apart from a mixture of herbs, she might be told to avoid ice-cold drinks, or excessive amounts of raw fruit.The patient would then take the herb mixture home and empty it into a glass, ceramic or stainless steel cooking pot, and add water. It is then brought to the boil and simmered three times. The patient then drains the mixture, throws the herbs away - or perhaps uses them for compost - and drinks the herbal soup that is left.Joan Luxemburg prefers to have a tablespoon with honey on standby after drinking the herbal soup. Not so long ago, Mrs Luxemburg was suffering excessively heavy periods, and an ultrasound detected fibroids. The condition was so bad that she had to wear incontinence pads. Her female GP suggested a hysterectomy, to be followed by hormone replacement therapy (HRT).But Mrs Luxemburg, who is 45, says she had three friends who were not particularly happy with their HRT. There had to be another way of making her body operate correctly. She had used natural therapies before, and Daniel Godel was recommended.Firstly, he prescribed herbal granules, which she says cleared up some indigestion she was having. Then some raw herbs provided some ""very good"" results. Now, she says, she has almost no menstrual problems.""I must say the whole experience of going to Daniel Godel was far more satisfying than attending any Western medical practitioner,"" she says. ""I felt listened to; it's like all the details matter.""For a PhD thesis, Shelley Beer is setting out to prove that Chinese herbal medicine can help women overcome menopausal problems. For the sake of scientific clarity, she will attempt in her medical research to prove just one thing: that it can overcome hot flushes.She is conducting a trial on 40 women aged 40 to 55; 20 of whom are on herbs and 20 on placebo or ""dummy"" treatment.The treatment under trial is a combination of cooked, dehydrated and granulated herbs known as bupleurum and peony.About 790 women have expressed interest in participating in the trial. ""I have already had some women who have finished the trial who have reported that their headaches have gone, their hot flushes are gone, and they are feeling good in themselves,"" Ms Beer says. She hopes to present her results at the World Menopause Congress in Sydney in November.Joan Luxemburg believes her experience with Chinese medicine is little short of a miracle, and certainly an improvement on using the contraceptive pill, which had side-effects, to control her heavy periods.At the time of writing, she is yet to undergo another ultrasound to see if her fibroids have gone. ""But if I'm not getting the symptoms,"" she says, ""then I'm not worried if they're there.""Shelley Beer is searching for more participants in her study.She can be contacted on 9365 2614 or (053) 481 314."
251,1252.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Unfair criticisms of alternative medicine,"from Rey Tiquia, lecturer on traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, health sciences department, Victorian University of Technology.The Australian Medical Association president Dr Brendan Nelson's comments about alternative medicine in the light of the fatal reaction of a Sydney girl to royal jelly (`The Age', 4/1), needs addressing. First of all, it is clear from reports that the mother, who was not an alternative practitioner, prescribed the fatal dose. Therefore, this is not an issue relating to the practice of alternative medicine.It is more an issue of food labelling, since this product is imported and sold as food. Responsibilities regarding labelling and information about products like royal jelly fall upon the shoulders of manufacturers and importers of these products. As a result of this fatality, such information must be upgraded.Royal jelly or wang jiang, is a milky pale yellow syrup made from flower nectar and secretion from the back of the throat of young worker bees. It is a nutritional substance eaten by the queen bee and larvae.According to the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), royal jelly has therapeutic attributes, which can restore imbalances in the functioning of the various organ systems of the body. It is used as a nourishing and ""tonifying"" substance that can benefit the liver system and reinforce the spleen system. The dosage prescribed varies from the minimum of 50milligrams to a maximum of 200milligrams.As for Mr Nelson's call for a ""rigorous scientific examination"" of alternative therapies such as royal jelly, I would like to draw his attention to Vol. 19, No. 11, 1988, and Vol. 20, No. 11, 1989, of the `Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs' journal, which documents scientific research into the various nutritional and chemical components of royal jelly.Mr Nelson should be made aware that the method of ""scientific examination"" is just one method of validation of knowledge systems.This method may be appropriate for the Western medical system but may not necessarily be so for TCM, which has its own method of validation based upon its practice.Rey Tiquia, Ivanhoe.

''By regulating traditional Chinese medicine, the provincial government recognizes it as an important and valued health option in our society,'' added Clark. ''I'm proud B.C. has taken this important step.''''I think (medicare coverage) is a logical progression once (we) recognize it as a legitimate form of medicine. The more emphasis we put on wellness, the more money we save in acute care.''Clark couldn't say when it could be included under medicare, only that such coverage would be predicated on, among other things, cost and public acceptance.The government decision to regulate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on recommendations made by the Health Professions Council. Cabinet is expected to give final approval to the proposed amendments following a three-month consultation process, as required by the Health Professions Act.Health Minister Penny Priddy, who was also on hand for the announcement in front of dozens of Chinese medicine providers, said the use of traditional Chinese medicine is growing throughout the province.''This decision recognizes the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine and gives practitioners here the legal authority to do what has been done elsewhere for thousands of years.''This is an excellent example of our commitment to providing a health-care system that incorporates the best health-care practices -- both old and new.''Mason Loh, past chair of the board of the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (SUCCESS), called Monday's announcement far-sighted.''Traditional Chinese medicine has been practised for thousands of years and is used by more than a billion people in China and elsewhere in the world,'' Loh said. ''I am also glad to see the government has taken the action necessary for acupuncturists to be licensed.''Loh will chair the college's new nine-member board of directors.James Knights, president of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association of B.C., called Monday's announcement a great boost.''This is tremendous for the people of B.C. and for our profession. The government has recognized the importance of regulating the vast treasure house of (traditional Chinese medicine) as a health profession for the benefit of the public.''This paves the way for an integration of TCM into mainstream health care so British Columbians can benefit from the two primary forms of health care that complement each other.''Knights said regulation means there will be better educational standards.''Without regulation, it (is) just a loose form of professional associations. There have been problems identifying educational backgrounds in the past. This will set standards of practice, so everyone has a certain minimum standard.''Knights said the new regulatory body will likely mean higher costs for practitioners, which could be passed on to patients.''But it shouldn't be high, because it would be spread out over a (large) number of patients.''Knights said he and other practitioners had initial concerns that regulating TCM might mean coming under the control of traditional medicine. He said Monday's announcement clears up those concerns.Knights said TCM focuses on preventing disease. ''We don't expect (medicare coverage) anytime soon, but it would be a money-saving issue.''It's very focused on prevention. The more people you keep out of hospital, the more money you save.''Morris Van Andel, deputy-registrar of the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons, agreed that regulation is a good idea.''The standards imposed on orthodox physicians are significant. I would hope those same high standards will apply.''Van Andel said the college has no position on whether traditional medicine should be covered by medicare.''But as a taxpayer, I hope that money (would) be spent wisely.''There's currently a fiscal crunch in health care. As a taxpayer, I hope I don't have to pay for shadow boxing.''"
